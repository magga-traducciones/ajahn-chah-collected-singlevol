<p><span class="dropcaps-first">A</span><span class="dropcaps-words">t this time please</span> 
determine your minds to listen to the Dhamma. Today is the traditional
day of <em>dhammasavaṇa.</em> It is the appropriate time for us, the host of
Buddhists, to study the Dhamma in order to increase our mindfulness and
wisdom. Giving and receiving the teachings is something we have been
doing for a long time. The activities we usually perform on this day,
chanting homage to the Buddha, taking moral precepts, meditating and
listening to teachings, should be understood as methods and principles
for spiritual development. They are not anything more than this.</p>

<p>When it comes to taking precepts, for example, a monk will proclaim the
precepts and the laypeople will vow to undertake them. Don’t
misunderstand what is going on. The truth is that morality is not
something that can be given. It can’t really be requested or received
from someone. We can’t give it to someone else. In our vernacular we
hear people say, ‘The venerable monk gave the precepts’ and ‘we received
the precepts.’ We talk like this here in the countryside and so it has
become our habitual way of understanding. If we think like this, that we
come to receive precepts from the monks on the lunar observance days and
that if the monks won’t give precepts, then we don’t have morality, that
is only a tradition of delusion that we have inherited from our
ancestors. Thinking in this way means that we give up our own
responsibility, not having firm trust and conviction in ourselves. Then
it gets passed down to the next generation, and they too come to
‘receive’ precepts from the monks. And the monks come to believe that
they are the ones who ‘give’ the precepts to the laity. In fact morality
and precepts are not like that. They are not something to be ‘given’ or
‘received’; but on ceremonial occasions of making merit and the like we
use this as a ritual form according to tradition and employ the
terminology.</p>

<p>In truth morality resides with the intentions of people. If you have the
conscious determination to refrain from harmful activities and
wrongdoing by way of body and speech, morality is coming about within
you. You should know it within yourself. It is okay to take the vows
with another person. You can also recollect the precepts by yourself. If
you don’t know what they are, you can request them from someone else. It
is not something very complicated or distant. So really whenever we wish
to receive morality and Dhamma we have them right then. It is just like
the air that surrounds us everywhere. Whenever we breathe we take it in.
All manner of good and evil is like that. If we wish to do good, we can
do it anywhere, at any time. We can do it alone or together with others.
Evil is the same. We can do it with a large or small group, in a hidden
or open place. It is like this.</p>

<p>These are things that are already in existence. But morality is
something that we should consider normal for all humans to practise. A
person who has no morality is no different from an animal. If you decide
to live like an animal, then of course there is no good or evil for you,
because an animal doesn’t have any knowledge of such things. A cat
catches mice, but we don’t say it is doing evil, because it has no
concepts or knowledge of good or bad, right or wrong. These beings are
outside the circle of human beings. It is the animal realm. The Buddha
pointed out that this group is just living according to the animal kind
of kamma. Those who understand right and wrong, good and evil, are
humans. The Buddha taught his Dhamma for humans. If we people don’t have
morality and knowledge of these things, then we are not much different
from animals; so it is appropriate that we study and learn about
morality and make ourselves able. This is taking advantage of the
precious accomplishment of human existence and bringing it to
fulfilment.</p>

<p>The profound Dhamma is the teaching that morality is necessary. When
there is morality, we have a foundation on which we can progress in
Dhamma. Morality means the precepts concerning what is forbidden and
what is permissible. Dhamma refers to nature and to humans knowing about
nature – how things exist according to nature. Nature is something we do
not compose. It exists as it is according to its conditions. A simple
example is animals. A certain species, such as peacocks, is born with
its various patterns and colours. They were not created like that by
humans or modified by humans; they are just born that way according to
nature. This is a little example of how it is in nature.</p>

<p>All things of nature are existing in the world – this is still talking
about understanding from a worldly viewpoint. The Buddha taught Dhamma
for us to know nature, to let go of it and let it exist according to its
conditions. This is talking about the external material world. As to
<em>nāmadhamma,</em> meaning the mind, it can not be left to follow its own
conditions. It has to be trained. In the end we can say that mind is the
teacher of body and speech, so it needs to be well trained. Letting it
go according to its natural urges just makes one an animal. It has to be
instructed and trained. It should come to know nature, but should not
merely be left to follow nature.</p>

<p>We are born into this world and all of us will naturally have the
afflictions of desire, anger and delusion. Desire makes us crave after
various things and causes the mind to be in a state of imbalance and
turmoil. Nature is like that. It will just not do to let the mind go
after these impulses of craving. It only leads to heat and distress. It
is better to train in Dhamma, in truth.</p>

<p>When aversion occurs in us we want to express anger towards people; it
may even get to the point of physically attacking or killing people. But
we don’t just ‘let it go’ according to its nature. We know the nature of
what is occurring. We see it for what it is, and teach the mind about
it. This is studying Dhamma.</p>

<p>Delusion is the same. When it happens, we are confused about things. If
we just leave it as it is, we remain in ignorance. So the Buddha told us
to know nature, to teach nature, to train and adjust nature, to know
exactly what nature is.</p>

<p>For example, people are born with physical form and mind. In the
beginning these things are born, in the middle they change and in the
end they are extinguished. This is ordinary; this is their nature. We
can not do much to alter these facts. We train our minds as we can and
when the time comes we have to let go of it all. It is beyond the
ability of humans to change this or get beyond it. The Dhamma that the
Buddha taught is something to be applied while we are here, for making
actions, words and thoughts correct and proper. He was teaching the
minds of people so that they would not be deluded in regard to nature,
conventional reality and supposition. The teacher instructed us to see
the world. His Dhamma was a teaching that is above and beyond the world.
We are in the world. We were born into this world; he taught us to
transcend the world and not to be a prisoner to worldly ways and habits.</p>

<p>It is like a diamond that falls into a muddy pit. No matter how much
dirt and filth covers it, that does not destroy its radiance, the hues
and the worth of it. Even though the mud is stuck to it, the diamond
does not lose anything, but is just as it originally was. There are two
separate things.</p>

<p>So the Buddha taught to be above the world, which means knowing the
world clearly. By ‘the world’ he did not mean so much the earth and sky
and elements, but rather the mind, the wheel of saṃsāra. within the
hearts of people. He meant this wheel, this world. This is the world the
Buddha knew clearly; when we talk about knowing the world clearly we are
talking about these things. If it were otherwise, the Buddha would have
had to be flying everywhere to ‘know the world clearly’. It is not like
that. It is a single point. All dhammas come down to one single point;
for instance, people – which means men and women. If we observe one man
and one woman, we know the nature of all people in the universe. They
are not that different.</p>

<p>Another example is learning about heat. If we just know this one point,
the quality of being hot, it does not matter what the source or cause of
the heat is; the condition of ‘hot’ is such. If we know clearly this one
point, then wherever there may be hotness in the universe, we know it is
like this. Because the Buddha knew a single point, his knowledge
encompassed the world. Knowing coldness to be a certain way, when he
encountered coldness anywhere in the world, he already knew it. He
taught a single point for beings living in the world to know the world,
to know the nature of the world, to know people – men and women – to
know the manner of existence of beings in the world. His knowledge was
such. Knowing one point, he knew all things.</p>

<p>The Dhamma that the teacher expounded was for going beyond suffering.
What is this ‘going beyond suffering’ all about? What should we do to
‘escape from suffering’? It is necessary for us to do some study; we
need to come and study the thinking and feeling in our hearts. Just
that. It is something we are presently unable to change. We can be free
of all suffering and unsatisfactoriness in life, just by changing this
one point: our habitual world view, our way of thinking and feeling. If
we come to have a new sense of things, a new understanding, we transcend
the old perceptions and understanding.</p>

<p>The authentic Dhamma of the Buddha is not something pointing far away.
It teaches about <em>attā</em>, self, and that things are not really self. That
is all. All the teachings that the Buddha gave were pointing out that
‘this is not a self, this does not belong to a self, there is no such
thing as ourselves or others.’ Now, when we contact this, we can’t
really read it, we don’t ‘translate’ the Dhamma correctly. We still
think ‘this is me, this is mine.’ We attach to things and invest them
with meaning. When we do this, we can’t yet disentangle from them; the
involvement deepens and the mess gets worse and worse. If we know that
there is no self, that body and mind are really <em>anattā</em> as the Buddha
taught, then when we keep on investigating, eventually we will come to
the realization of the actual condition of selflessness. We will
genuinely realize that there is no self or other. Pleasure is merely
pleasure. Feeling is merely feeling. Memory is merely memory. Thinking
is merely thinking. They are all things that are ‘merely’ such.
Happiness is merely happiness; suffering is merely suffering. Good is
merely good, evil is merely evil. Everything exists merely thus.</p>

<p>There is no real happiness or real suffering. There are just the merely
existing conditions: merely happy, merely suffering, merely hot, merely
cold, merely a being or a person. You should keep looking to see that
things are only so much. Only earth, only water, only fire, only wind.
We should keep on ‘reading’ these things and investigating this point.
Eventually our perception will change; we will have a different feeling
about things. The tightly held conviction that there is self and things
belonging to self will gradually come undone. When this sense of things
is removed, then the opposite perception will keep increasing steadily.</p>

<p>When the realization of <em>anattā</em> comes to full measure, we will be able
to relate to the things of this world – to our most cherished
possessions and involvements, to friends and relations, to wealth,
accomplishments and status – just the same as we do to our clothes. When
shirts and pants are new we wear them; they get dirty and we wash them;
after some time they are worn out and we discard them. There is nothing
out of the ordinary there. We are constantly getting rid of the old
things and starting to use new garments.</p>

<p>We will have the exact same feeling about our existence in this world.
We will not cry or moan over things. We will not be tormented or
burdened by them. They remain the same things as they were before, but
our feeling and understanding of them has changed. Now our knowledge
will be exalted and we will see truth. We will have attained supreme
vision and have learned the authentic knowledge of the Dhamma that we
ought to know and to see. Where is the Dhamma that we ought to know and
see? It is right here within us, within this body and mind. We have it
already; we should come to know and see it.</p>

<p>All of us have been born into this human realm. Whatever we gained by
that we are going to lose. We have seen people born and seen them die.
We just see this happening, but don’t really see clearly. When there is
a birth, we rejoice over it; when people die, we cry for them. There is
no end. It goes on in this way and there is no end to our foolishness.
Seeing birth we are foolhardy. Seeing death we are foolhardy. There is
only this unending foolishness. Let’s take a look at all this. These
things are natural occurrences. Contemplate the Dhamma here, the Dhamma
that we should know and see. This Dhamma is existing right now. Make up
your minds about this. Exert restraint and self-control. Now we are
amidst the things of this life. We shouldn’t have fears of death. We
should fear the lower realms. Don’t fear dying; rather be afraid of
falling into hell. You should be afraid of doing wrong while you still
have life. These are old things we are dealing with, not new things.
Some people are alive but don’t know themselves at all. They think,
‘What’s the big deal about what I do now? I can’t know what is going to
happen when I die.’ They don’t think about the new seeds they are
creating for the future. They only see the old fruit.</p>

<p>They fixate on present experience, not realizing that if there is fruit
it must have come from a seed, and that within the fruit we have now are
the seeds of future fruit. These seeds are just waiting to be planted.
Actions born of ignorance continue the chain in this way, but when you
are eating the fruit you don’t think about all the implications.</p>

<p>Wherever the mind has a lot of attachment, we will experience intense
suffering, intense grief, intense difficulty right there. The place we
experience the most problems is the place we have the most attraction,
longing and concern. Please try to resolve this. Now, while you still
have life and breath, keep on looking at it and reading it until you are
able to ‘translate’ it and solve the problem.</p>

<p>Whatever we are experiencing as part of our lives now, one day we will
be parted from it. So don’t just pass the time. Practise spiritual
cultivation. Take this parting, this separation and loss as your object
of contemplation right now in the present, until you are clever and
skilled in it, until you can see that it is ordinary and natural. When
there is anxiety and regret over it, have the wisdom to recognize the
limits of this anxiety and regret, knowing what they are according to
the truth. If you can consider things in this way then wisdom will
arise. Whenever suffering occurs, wisdom can arise there, if we
investigate. But people generally do not want to investigate.</p>

<p>Wherever pleasant or unpleasant experience happens, wisdom can arise
there. If we know happiness and suffering for what they really are, then
we know the Dhamma. If we know the Dhamma, we know the world clearly; if
we know the world clearly, we know the Dhamma.</p>

<p>Actually, for most of us, if something is displeasing we don’t really
want to know about it. We get caught up in the aversion to it. If we
dislike someone, we don’t want to look at his face or get anywhere near
him. This is the mark of a foolish, unskilful person; this is not the
way of a good person. If we like someone then of course we want to be
close to him, we make every effort to be with him, taking delight in his
company. This also is foolishness. They are actually the same, like the
palm and back of the hand. When we turn the hand up and see the palm,
the back of the hand is hidden from sight. When we turn it over then the
palm is not seen.</p>

<p>Pleasure hides pain and pain hides pleasure from our sight. Wrong covers
up right, right covers wrong. Just looking at one side our knowledge is
not complete. Let’s do things completely while we still have life. Keep
on looking at things, separating truth from falsehood, noting how things
really are, getting to the end of it, reaching peace. When the time
comes we will be able to cut through and let go completely. Now we have
to firmly attempt to separate things – and keep trying to cut through.</p>

<p>The Buddha taught about hair, nails, skin and teeth. He taught us to
separate them. A person who does not know about separating only knows
about holding them to himself. Now while we have not yet parted from
these things we should be skilful in meditating on them. We have not yet
left this world, so we should be careful. We should contemplate a lot,
make copious charitable offerings, recite the scriptures a lot, practise
a lot. We should develop insight into impermanence, unsatisfactoriness,
and selflessness. Even if the mind does not want to listen, we should
keep on breaking things up like this and come to know in the present.
This can most definitely be done. One can realize knowledge that
transcends the world. We are stuck in the world. This is a way to
‘destroy’ the world, through contemplating and seeing beyond the world
so that we can transcend the world in our being. Even while we are
living in this world our view can be above the world.</p>

<p>In a worldly existence one creates both good and evil. Now we try to
practise virtue and give up evil. When good results come, then you
should not be under that good, but be able to transcend it. If you do
not transcend it, then you become a slave to virtue and to your concepts
of what is good. It puts you in difficulty, and there will not be an end
to your tears. It does not matter how much good you have practised, if
you are attached to it then you are still not free and there will be no
end to tears. But one who transcends good as well as evil has no more
tears to shed. They have dried up. There can be an end. We should learn
to use virtue, not to be used by virtue.</p>

<p>In a nutshell, the point of the teaching of the Buddha is to transform
one’s view. It is possible to change it. It only requires looking at
things and then it happens. Having been born we will experience ageing,
illness, death and separation. These things are right here. We don’t
need to look up at the sky or down at the earth. The Dhamma that we need
to see and to know can be seen right here within us, every moment of
every day. When there is a birth, we are filled with joy. When there is
a death, we grieve. That’s how we spend our lives. These are the things
we need to know about, but we still have not really looked into them and
seen the truth. We are stuck deep in this ignorance. We ask, ‘When will
we see the Dhamma?’ – but it is right here to be seen in the present.</p>

<p>This is the Dhamma we should learn about and see. This is what the
Buddha taught about. He did not teach about gods and demons and <em>nāga,</em>
protective deities, jealous demigods, nature spirits and the like. He
taught the things that one should know and see. These are truths that we
really should be able to realize. External phenomena are like this,
exhibiting the <em>three characteristics.</em></p>

<p>If we really take an interest in all of this and contemplate seriously
we can gain genuine knowledge. If this were something that could not be
done, the Buddha would not have bothered to talk about it. How many tens
and hundreds of thousands of his followers have come to realization? If
one is really keen on looking at things, one can come to know. The
Dhamma is like that. We are living in this world. The Buddha wanted us
to know the world. Living in the world, we gain our knowledge from the
world. The Buddha is said to be <em>lokavidū,</em> one who knows the world
clearly. It means living in the world but not being stuck in the ways of
the world, living among attraction and aversion but not stuck in
attraction and aversion. This can be spoken about and explained in
ordinary language. This is how the Buddha taught.</p>

<p>Normally we speak in terms of <em>attā</em>, self, talking about me and mine,
you and yours, but the mind can remain uninterruptedly in the
realization of <em>anattā</em>, selflessness. Think about it. When we talk to
children we speak in one way; when dealing with adults we speak in
another way. If we use words appropriate to children to speak with
adults, or use adults’ words to speak with children, it won’t work out.
We have to know the proper use of conventions when we are talking to
children. It can be appropriate to talk about me and mine, you and yours
and so forth, but inwardly the mind is Dhamma, dwelling in realization
of <em>anattā</em>. You should have this kind of foundation.</p>

<p>So the Buddha said that you should take the Dhamma as your foundation,
basis and practice, when living in the world. It is not right to take
your ideas, desires and opinions as a basis. The Dhamma should be your
standard. If you take yourself as the standard you become self-absorbed.
If you take someone else as your standard you are merely infatuated with
that person. Being enthralled with ourselves or with another person is
not the way of Dhamma. The Dhamma does not incline to any person or
follow personalities. It follows the truth. It does not simply accord
with the likes and dislikes of people; such habitual reactions have
nothing to do with the truth of things.</p>

<p>If we really consider all of this and investigate thoroughly to know the
truth, then we will enter the correct path. Our way of living will
become correct. Thinking will be correct. Our actions and speech will be
correct. So we really should look into all of this. Why is it that we
have suffering? Because of lack of knowledge, not knowing where things
begin and end, not understanding the causes; this is ignorance. When
there is this ignorance then various desires arise, and being driven by
them we create the causes of suffering. Then the result must be
suffering. When you gather firewood and light a match to it, expecting
not to have any heat, what are your chances? You are creating a fire,
aren’t you? This is origination itself.</p>

<p>If you understand these things, morality will be born here. Dhamma will
be born here. So prepare yourselves. The Buddha advised us to prepare
ourselves. You needn’t have too many concerns or anxieties about things.
Just look here. Look at the place without desires, the place without
danger. The Buddha taught ‘<em>Nibbāna paccayo hotu</em>’ – let it be a cause
for Nibbāna. If it will be a cause for realization of Nibbāna, it means
looking at the place where things are empty, where things are done with,
where they reach their end, where they are exhausted. Look at the place
where there are no more causes, where there is no more self or other, me
or mine. This looking becomes a cause or condition, a condition for
attaining Nibbāna. Practising generosity becomes a cause for realizing
Nibbāna. Practising morality becomes a cause for realizing Nibbāna.
Listening to the teachings becomes a cause for realizing Nibbāna. Thus
we can dedicate all our Dhamma activities to become causes for Nibbāna.
But if we are not looking towards Nibbāna, if we are looking at self and
other and attachment and grasping without end, this does not become a
cause for Nibbāna.</p>

<p>When we deal with others and they talk about self, about me and mine,
about what is ours, we immediately agree with this viewpoint. We
immediately think, ‘Yeah, that’s right!’ But it’s not right. Even if the
mind is saying, ‘Right, right,’ we have to exert control over it. It’s
the same as a child who is afraid of ghosts. Maybe the parents are
afraid too. But it won’t do for the parents to talk about it; if they
do, the child will feel he has no protection or security. ‘No, of course
Daddy is not afraid. Don’t worry, Daddy is here. There are no ghosts.
There’s nothing to worry about.’ Well the father might really be afraid
too. If he starts talking about it, they will all get so worked up about
ghosts that they’ll jump up and run away – father, mother and child –
and end up homeless.</p>

<p>This is not being clever. You have to look at things clearly and learn
how to deal with them. Even when you feel that deluded appearances are
real, you have to tell yourself that they are not. Go against it like
this. Teach yourself inwardly. When the mind is experiencing the world
in terms of self, saying, ‘It’s true,’ you have to be able to tell it,
‘It’s not true.’ You should be floating above the water, and not be
submerged by the flood-waters of worldly habit. The water is flooding
our hearts if we run after things; do we ever look at what is going on?
Will there be anyone ‘watching the house’?</p>

<p><em>Nibbāna paccayo hotu</em> – one need not aim at anything or wish for
anything at all. Just aim for Nibbāna. All manner of becoming and birth,
merit and virtue in the worldly way, do not lead there. We don’t need to
be wishing for a lot of things, making merit and skilful kamma, hoping
it will cause us to attain to some better state, just aim directly for
Nibbāna. Wanting sīla, wanting tranquillity, we just end up in the same
old place. It’s not necessary to desire these things – we should just
wish for the place of cessation.</p>

<p>It is like this. Throughout all our becoming and birth, all of us are so
terribly anxious about so many things. When there is separation, when
there is death, we cry and lament. I can only think, how utterly foolish
this is. What are we crying about? Where do you think people are going
anyhow? If they are still bound up in becoming and birth they are not
really going away. When children grow up and move to the big city of
Bangkok they still think of their parents. They won’t be missing someone
else’s parents, just their own. When they return they will go to their
parents’ home, not someone else’s. And when they go away again they will
still think about their home here in Ubon. Will they be homesick for
some other place? What do you think? So when the breath ends and we die,
no matter through how many lifetimes, if the causes for becoming and
birth still exist, the consciousness is likely to try and take birth in
a place it is familiar with. I think we are just too fearful about all
of this. So please don’t go crying about it too much. Think about this.
‘<em>Kammaṃ satte vibhajati</em>’ – kamma drives beings into their various
births – they don’t go very far. Spinning back and forth through the
round of births, that is all, just changing appearances, appearing with
a different face next time, but we don’t know it. Just coming and going,
going and returning in the loop of saṃsāra, not really going anywhere.
Just staying there. Like a mango that is shaken off the tree, like the
snare that does not get the wasps’ nest and falls to the ground; it is
not going anywhere. It is just staying there. So the Buddha said,
‘<em>Nibbāna paccayo hotu</em>’: let your only aim be Nibbāna. Strive hard to
accomplish this; don’t end up like the mango falling to the ground and
going nowhere.</p>

<p>Transform your sense of things like this. If you can change it you will
know great peace. Change, please; come to see and know. These are things
one should indeed see and know. If you do see and know, then where else
do you need to go? Morality will come to be. Dhamma will come to be. It
is nothing far away; so please investigate this.</p>

<p>When you transform your view, you will realize that it is like watching
leaves fall from the trees. When they get old and dry, they fall from
the tree. And when the season comes, they begin to appear again. Would
anyone cry when leaves fall, or laugh when they grow? If you did, you
would be insane, wouldn’t you? It is just this much. If we can see
things in this way, we will be okay. We will know that this is just the
natural order of things. It doesn’t matter how many births we undergo,
it will always be like this. When one studies Dhamma, gains clear
knowledge and undergoes a change of world view like this, one will
realize peace and be free of bewilderment about the phenomena of this
life.</p>

<p>But the important point really is that we have life now in the present.
We are experiencing the results of past deeds right now. When beings are
born into the world, this is the manifestation of past actions. Whatever
happiness or suffering beings have in the present is the fruit of what
they have done previously. It is born of the past and experienced in the
present. Then this present experience becomes the basis for the future
as we create further causes under its influence, and so future
experience becomes the result. The movement from one birth to the next
also happens in this way. You should understand this.</p>

<p>Listening to the Dhamma should resolve your doubts. It should clarify
your view of things and alter your way of living. When doubts are
resolved, suffering can end. You stop creating desires and mental
afflictions. Then whatever you experience, if something is displeasing
to you, you will not suffer over it because you understand its
changeability. If something is pleasing to you, you will not get carried
away and become intoxicated by it because you know the way to let go of
things appropriately. You maintain a balanced perspective, because you
understand impermanence and know how to resolve things according to
Dhamma. You know that good and bad conditions are always changing.
Knowing internal phenomena, you understand external phenomena. Not
attached to the external, you are not attached to the internal.
Observing things within yourself or outside of yourself, it is all
completely the same.</p>

<p>In this way we can dwell in a natural state, which is peace and
tranquillity. If we are criticized, we remain undisturbed. If we are
praised, we are undisturbed. Let things be in this way; don’t be
influenced by others. This is freedom. Knowing the two extremes for what
they are, one can experience well-being. One does not stop at either
side. This is genuine happiness and peace, transcending all things of
the world. One transcends all good and evil. One is above cause and
effect, beyond birth and death. Born into this world, one can transcend
the world. To be beyond the world, knowing the world – this is the aim
of the Buddha’s teaching. He did not aim for people to suffer. He
desired people to attain peace, to know the truth of things and realize
wisdom. This is Dhamma, knowing the nature of things. Whatever exists in
the world is nature. There is no need to be in confusion about it.
Wherever you are, the same laws apply.</p>

<p>The most important point is that while we have life, we should train the
mind to be even in regard to things. We should be able to share wealth
and possessions. When the time comes we should give a portion to those
in need, just as if we were giving things to our own children. Sharing
things like this we will feel happy; and if we can give away all our
wealth, then whenever our breath may stop, there will be no attachment
or anxiety because everything is gone. The Buddha taught to ‘die before
you die’, to be finished with things before they are finished. Then you
can be at ease. Let things break before they are broken, let them finish
before they are finished. This is the Buddha’s intention in teaching the
Dhamma. Even if you listen to teachings for a hundred or a thousand
aeons, if you do not understand these points, you won’t be able to undo
your suffering and you will not find peace. You will not see the Dhamma.
But understanding these things according to the Buddha’s intention and
being able to resolve things is called seeing the Dhamma. This view of
things can make an end of suffering. It can relieve all heat and
distress. Whoever strives sincerely and is diligent in practice, who can
endure, who trains and develops themselves to the full measure: those
persons will attain to peace and cessation. Wherever they stay, they
will have no suffering. Whether they are young or old they will be free
of suffering. Whatever their situation, whatever work they have to
perform, they will have no suffering because their minds have reached
the place where suffering is exhausted, where there is peace. It is like
this. It is a matter of nature.</p>

<p>The Buddha thus said to change one’s perceptions, and there will be the
Dhamma. When the mind is in harmony with Dhamma, then Dhamma enters the
heart. The mind and the Dhamma become indistinguishable. The changing of
one’s view and experience of things is something to be realized by those
who practise. The entire Dhamma is <em>paccattaṃ,</em> to be known personally.
It can not be given by anyone; that is an impossibility. If we hold it
to be difficult, it will be something difficult. If we take it to be
easy, it is easy. Whoever contemplates it and sees the one point does
not have to know a lot of things. Seeing the one point, seeing birth and
death, the arising and passing away of phenomena according to nature,
one will know all things. This is a matter of the truth.</p>

<p>This is the way of the Buddha. The Buddha gave his teachings out of the
wish to benefit all beings. He wished for us to go beyond suffering and
to attain peace. It is not that we have to die first in order to
transcend suffering. We shouldn’t think that we will attain this after
death; we can go beyond suffering here and now, in the present. We
transcend within our perception of things, in this very life, through
the view that arises in our minds. Then sitting, we are happy; lying
down, we are happy; wherever we are, we are happy. We become without
fault, experience no ill results, and live in a state of freedom. The
mind is clear, bright, and tranquil. There is no more darkness or
defilement. This is someone who has reached the supreme happiness of the
Buddha’s way. Please investigate this for yourselves. All of you lay
followers, please contemplate this to gain understanding and ability. If
you suffer, then practise to alleviate your suffering. If it is great,
make it little, and if it is little, make an end of it. Everyone has to
do this for themselves, so please make an effort to consider these
words. May you prosper and develop.</p>
