<p class="chapter-footnote"><em>Note</em>: This talk has been
published elsewhere under the title: ‘<em>Not Sure! – The Standard of the
Noble Ones</em>’</p>

<p><span class="dropcaps-first">T</span><span class="dropcaps-words">here was once</span>  a
Western monk, a student of mine. Whenever he saw Thai monks and novices
disrobing he would say, ‘Oh, what a shame! Why do they do that? Why do
so many of the Thai monks and novices disrobe?’ He was shocked. He would
get saddened at the disrobing of the Thai monks and novices, because he
had only just come into contact with Buddhism. He was inspired, he was
resolute. Going forth as a monk was the only thing to do, he thought
he’d never disrobe. Whoever disrobed was a fool. He’d see the Thais
taking on the robes at the beginning of the Rains Retreat as monks and
novices and then disrobing at the end of it. He would say ‘Oh, how sad!
I feel so sorry for those Thai monks and novices. How could they do such
a thing?’</p>

<p>Well, as time went by some of the Western monks began to disrobe, so he
came to see it as something not so important after all. At first, when
he had just begun to practise, he was excited about it. He thought that
it was a really important thing, to become a monk. He thought it would
be easy.</p>

<p>When people are inspired it all seems to be so right and good. There’s
nothing there to gauge their feelings by, so they go ahead and decide
for themselves. But they don’t really know what practice is. Those who
do know will have a thoroughly firm foundation within their hearts – but
even so they don’t need to advertise it.</p>

<p>As for myself, when I was first ordained I didn’t actually do much
practice, but I had a lot of faith. I don’t know why, maybe it was there
from birth. The monks and novices who went forth together with me, all
disrobed at the end of the Rains. I thought to myself, ‘Eh? What is it
with these people?’ However, I didn’t dare say anything to them because
I wasn’t yet sure of my own feelings, I was too stirred up. But within
me I felt that they were all foolish. ‘It’s difficult to go forth, easy
to disrobe. These guys don’t have much merit, they think that the way of
the world is more useful than the way of Dhamma.’ I thought like this
but I didn’t say anything, I just watched my own mind.</p>

<p>I’d see the monks who’d gone forth with me disrobing one after the
other. Sometimes they’d dress up and come back to the monastery to show
off. I’d see them and think they were crazy, but they thought they
looked snappy. When you disrobe you have to do this and that. I’d think
to myself that that way of thinking was wrong. I wouldn’t say it,
though, because I myself was still an uncertain quantity. I still wasn’t
sure how long my faith would last.</p>

<p>When my friends had all disrobed I dropped all concern, there was nobody
left to concern myself with. I picked up the <em>Pāṭimokkha</em> and got stuck
into learning that. There was nobody left to distract me and waste my
time, so I put my heart into the practice. Still I didn’t say anything
because I felt that to practise all one’s life, maybe seventy, eighty or
even ninety years, and to keep up a persistent effort, without
slackening up or losing one’s resolve, seemed like an extremely
difficult thing to do.</p>

<p>Those who went forth would go forth, those who disrobed would disrobe.
I’d just watch it all. I didn’t concern myself whether they stayed or
went. I’d watch my friends leave, but the feeling I had within me was
that these people didn’t see clearly. That Western monk probably thought
like that. He’d see people become monks for only one Rains Retreat, and
get upset.</p>

<p>Later on he reached a stage we call bored; bored with the Holy Life. He
let go of the practice and eventually disrobed.</p>

<p>‘Why are you disrobing? Before, when you saw the Thai monks disrobing
you’d say, “Oh, what a shame! How sad, how pitiful.” Now, when you
yourself want to disrobe, why don’t you feel sorry?’</p>

<p>He didn’t answer. He just grinned sheepishly.</p>

<p>When it comes to the training of the mind it isn’t easy to find a good
standard if you haven’t yet developed a ‘witness’ within yourself. In
most external matters we can rely on others for feedback, there are
standards and precedents. But when it comes to using the Dhamma as a
standard, do we have the Dhamma yet? Are we thinking rightly or not? And
even if it’s right, do we know how to let go of rightness or are we
still clinging to it?</p>

<p>You must contemplate until you reach the point where you let go, this is
the important thing, until you reach the point where there isn’t
anything left, where there is neither good nor bad. You throw it off.
This means you throw out everything. If it’s all gone, then there’s no
remainder; if there’s some remainder, then it’s not all gone.</p>

<p>So in regard to this training of the mind, sometimes we may say it’s
easy. It’s easy to say, but it’s hard to do, very hard. It’s hard in
that it doesn’t conform to our desires. Sometimes it seems almost as if
the angels are helping us out. Everything goes right, whatever we think
or say seems to be just right. Then we go and attach to that rightness
and before long we go wrong and it all turns bad. This is where it’s
difficult. We don’t have a standard to gauge things by.</p>

<p>People who have a lot of faith, who are endowed with confidence and
belief but are lacking in wisdom, may be very good at samādhi but they
may not have much insight. They see only one side of everything, and
simply follow that. They don’t reflect. This is blind faith. In Buddhism
we call this <em>saddhā-adhimokkha</em>, blind faith. They have faith all right
but it’s not born of wisdom. But they don’t see this at the time; they
believe they have wisdom, so they don’t see where they are wrong.</p>

<p>Therefore, they teach about the five powers (<em>balā</em>): <em>saddhā</em>,
<em>viriya</em>, sati, samādhi, paññā. <em>Saddhā</em> is conviction; <em>viriya</em> is
diligent effort; sati is recollection; samādhi is fixedness of mind;
paññā is all-embracing knowledge. Don’t say that paññā is simply
knowledge – paññā is all-embracing, consummate knowledge.</p>

<p>The wise have given these five steps to us so that we can link them,
firstly as an object of study, then as a gauge to use for measuring the
state of our practice as it is. For example, <em>saddhā</em>, conviction. Do we
have conviction, have we developed it yet? <em>Viriya</em>: do we have diligent
effort or not? Is our effort right or is it wrong? We must consider
this. Everybody has some sort of effort, but does our effort contain
wisdom or not?</p>

<p>Sati is the same. Even a cat has sati. When it sees a mouse, sati is
there. The cat’s eyes stare fixedly at the mouse. This is the sati of a
cat. Everybody has sati, animals have it, delinquents have it, sages
have it.</p>

<p>Samādhi, fixedness of mind – everybody has this as well. A cat has it
when its mind is fixed on grabbing the mouse and eating it. It has fixed
intent. That sati of the cat’s is sati of a sort; samādhi, fixed intent
on what it is doing, is also there. Paññā, knowledge, like that of human
beings. It knows as an animal knows, it has enough knowledge to catch
mice for food.</p>

<p>These five things are called powers. Have these five powers arisen from
<em>sammā-diṭṭhi,</em> or not? <em>Saddhā</em>, <em>viriya</em>, sati, samādhi, paññā – have
these arisen from right view? What is right view? What is our standard
for gauging right view? We must clearly understand this.</p>

<p>Right view is the understanding that all these things are uncertain.
Therefore, the Buddha and all the Noble Ones don’t hold fast to them.
They hold, but not fast. They don’t let that holding become an identity.
The holding which doesn’t lead to becoming is that which isn’t tainted
with desire. Without seeking to become this or that there is simply the
practice itself. When you hold on to a particular thing, is there
enjoyment, or is there displeasure? If there is pleasure, do you hold on
to that pleasure? If there is dislike, do you hold on to that dislike?</p>

<p>Some views can be used as principles for gauging our practice more
accurately: for instance knowing views such as one is better than
others, or equal to others, or more foolish than others – knowing them
all as wrong views. We may feel these things but we also know them with
wisdom, that they simply arise and cease. Seeing that we are better than
others is not right; seeing that we are equal to others is not right;
seeing that we are inferior to others is not right.</p>

<p>The right view is the one that cuts through all of this. So where do we
go to? If we think we are better than others, pride arises. It’s there
but we don’t see it. If we think we are equal to others, we fail to show
respect and humility at the proper times. If we think we are inferior to
others we get depressed, thinking we are inferior, born under a bad sign
and so on. We are still clinging to the five khandhas, it’s all simply
becoming and birth.</p>

<p>This is one standard for gauging ourselves by. Another one is: if we
encounter a pleasant experience we feel happy, if we encounter a bad
experience we are unhappy. Are we able to look at both the things we
like and the things we dislike as having equal value? Measure yourself
against this standard. In our everyday lives, in the various experiences
we encounter, if we hear something which we like, does our mood change?
If we encounter an experience which isn’t to our liking, does our mood
change? Or is the mind unmoved? Looking right here we have our gauge.</p>

<p>Just know yourself, this is your witness. Don’t make decisions on the
strength of your desires. Desires can puff us up into thinking we are
something which we’re not. We must be very circumspect.</p>

<p>There are so many angles and aspects to consider, but the right way is
not to follow your desires, but the Truth. We should know both the good
and the bad, and when we know them to let go of them. If we don’t let go
we are still there, we still ‘exist’, we still ‘have’. If we still ‘are’
then there is a remainder, becoming and birth are in store.</p>

<p>Therefore the Buddha said to judge only yourself; don’t judge others, no
matter how good or evil they may be. The Buddha merely points out the
way, saying ‘The truth is like this.’ Now, is our mind like that or not?</p>

<p>For instance, suppose a monk took some things belonging to another monk.
Then that other monk accused him, ‘You stole my things.’ ‘I didn’t steal
them, I only took them.’ So we ask a third monk to adjudicate. How
should he decide? He would have to ask the offending monk to appear
before the convened Saṅgha. ‘Yes, I took it, but I didn’t steal it.’ Or
in regard to other rules, such as <em>pārājika</em> or <em>saṅghādisesa</em> offences:
‘Yes, I did it, but I didn’t have intention.’ How can you believe that?
It’s tricky. If you can’t believe it, all you can do is leave the onus
with the doer, it rests on him.</p>

<p>But you should know that we can’t hide the things that arise in our
minds. You can’t cover them up, either the wrongs or the good actions.
Whether actions are good or evil, you can’t dismiss them simply by
ignoring them, because these things tend to reveal themselves. They
conceal themselves, they reveal themselves, they exist in and of
themselves. They are all automatic. This is how things work.</p>

<p>Don’t try to guess at or speculate about these things. As long as there
is still <em>avijjā</em> they are not finished with. The Chief Privy Councillor
once asked me, ‘Luang Por, is the mind of an <em>anāgāmī</em> pure yet?’</p>

<p>‘It’s partly pure.’</p>

<p>‘Eh? An <em>anāgāmī</em> has given up sensual desire, how is his mind not yet
pure?’</p>

<p>‘He may have let go of sensual desire, but there is still something
remaining, isn’t there? There is still <em>avijjā</em>. If there is still
something left then there is still something left. It’s like the
bhikkhus’ alms bowls. There are, a large-sized large bowl, a
medium-sized large bowl, a small-sized large bowl; then a large-sized
medium bowl, a medium-sized medium bowl, a small-sized medium bowl; then
there are a large-sized small bowl, a medium-sized small bowl and a
small-sized small bowl. No matter how small it is there is still a bowl
there, right? That’s how it is with this – <em>sotāpanna</em>, <em>sakadāgāmī</em>,
<em>anāgāmī</em>. They have all given up certain defilements, but only to their
respective levels. Whatever still remains, those Noble Ones don’t see.
If they could they would all be arahants. They still can’t see all.
<em>Avijjā</em> is that which doesn’t see. If the mind of the <em>anāgāmī</em> was
completely straightened out he wouldn’t be an <em>anāgāmī</em>, he would be
fully accomplished. But there is still something remaining.’</p>

<p>‘Is his mind purified?’</p>

<p>‘Well, it is somewhat, but not 100 percent.’</p>

<p>How else could I answer? He said that later on he would come and
question me about it further. He can look into it, the standard is
there.</p>

<p>Don’t be careless. Be alert. The Lord Buddha exhorted us to be alert. In
regards to this training of the heart, I’ve had my moments of temptation
too, you know. I’ve often been tempted to try many things but they’ve
always seemed like they’re going astray of the path. It’s really just a
sort of swaggering in one’s mind, a sort of conceit. <em>Diṭṭhi</em> (views)
and <em>māna</em> (pride) are there. It’s hard enough just to be aware of these
two things.</p>

<p>There was once a man who wanted to become a monk here. He carried in his
robes, determined to become a monk in memory of his late mother. He came
into the monastery, laid down his robes, and without so much as paying
respects to the monks, started walking meditation right in front of the
main hall back and forth, back and forth, like he was really going to
show his stuff.</p>

<p>I thought, ‘Oh, so there are people around like this, too!’ This is
called <em>saddhā</em> <em>adhimokkha</em> – blind faith. He must have determined to
get enlightened before sundown or something, he thought it would be so
easy. He didn’t look at anybody else, he just put his head down and
walked as if his life depended on it. I just let him carry on, but I
thought, ‘Oh, man, you think it’s that easy or something?’ In the end I
don’t know how long he stayed, I don’t even think he ordained.</p>

<p>As soon as the mind thinks of something we send it out, send it out
every time. We don’t realize that it’s simply the habitual proliferation
of the mind. It disguises itself as wisdom and waffles off into minute
detail. This mental proliferation seems very clever; if we didn’t know,
we would mistake it for wisdom. But when it comes to the crunch it’s not
the real thing. When suffering arises where is that so-called wisdom
then? Is it of any use? It’s only proliferation after all.</p>

<p>So stay with the Buddha. As I’ve said before many times, in our practice
we must turn inwards and find the Buddha. Where is the Buddha? The
Buddha is still alive to this very day, go in and find him. Where is he?
At <em>aniccaṃ</em>, go in and find him there, go and bow to him: <em>aniccaṃ</em>,
uncertainty. You can stop right there for starters.</p>

<p>If the mind tries to tell you, ‘I’m a <em>sotāpanna</em> now,’ go and bow to
the <em>sotāpanna</em>. He’ll tell you himself, ‘It’s all uncertain.’ If you
meet a <em>sakadāgāmī</em> go and pay respects to him. When he sees you he’ll
simply say, ‘Not a sure thing!’ If there is an <em>anāgāmī</em> go and bow to
him. He’ll tell you only one thing – ‘Uncertain.’ If you even meet an
arahant, go and bow to him, he’ll tell you even more firmly, ‘It’s all
even more uncertain!’ You’ll hear the words of the Noble Ones:
‘everything is uncertain, don’t cling to anything.’</p>

<p>Don’t just look at the Buddha like a simpleton. Don’t cling to things,
holding fast to them without letting go. Look at things as functions of
the apparent and then send them on to transcendence. That’s how you must
be. There must be appearance and there must be transcendence.</p>

<p>So I say, ‘Go to the Buddha.’ Where is the Buddha? The Buddha is the
Dhamma. All the teachings in this world can be contained in this one
teaching: <em>aniccaṃ</em>. Think about it. I’ve searched for over forty years
as a monk and this is all I could find. That and patient endurance. This
is how to approach the Buddha’s teaching – <em>aniccaṃ</em>: it’s all
uncertain.</p>

<p>No matter how sure the mind wants to be, just tell it, ‘Not sure!’
Whenever the mind wants to grab on to something as a sure thing, just
say, ‘It’s not sure, it’s transient.’ Just ram it down with this. Using
the Dhamma of the Buddha it all comes down to this. It’s not that it’s
merely a momentary phenomenon. Whether standing, walking, sitting or
lying down, you see everything in that way. Whether liking arises or
dislike arises you see it all in the same way. This is getting close to
the Buddha, close to the Dhamma.</p>

<p>Now I feel that this is a more valuable way to practise. All my practice
from the early days up to the present time has been like this. I didn’t
actually rely on the scriptures, but then I didn’t disregard them
either. I didn’t rely on a teacher but then I didn’t exactly ‘go it
alone’. My practice was all ‘neither this nor that’.</p>

<p>Frankly it’s a matter of ‘finishing off’; that is, practising to the
finish by taking up the practice and then seeing it to completion,
seeing the apparent and also the transcendent.</p>

<p>I’ve already spoken of this, but some of you may be interested to hear
it again: if you practise consistently and consider things thoroughly,
you will eventually reach this point. At first you hurry to go forward,
hurry to come back, and hurry to stop. You continue to practise like
this until you reach the point where it seems that going forward is not
it, coming back is not it, and stopping is not it either! It’s finished.
This is the finish. Don’t expect anything more than this, it finishes
right here. <em>Khīṇāsavo</em> – one who is completed. He doesn’t go forward,
doesn’t retreat and doesn’t stop. There’s no stopping, no going forward
and no coming back. It’s finished. Consider this, realize it clearly in
your own mind. Right there you will find that there is really nothing at
all.</p>

<p>Whether this is old or new to you depends on you, on your wisdom and
discernment. One who has no wisdom or discernment won’t be able to
figure it out. Just take a look at trees, like mango or jackfruit trees.
If they grow up in a clump, one tree may get bigger first and then the
others will bend away, growing outwards from that bigger one. Why does
this happen? Who tells them to do that? This is nature. Nature contains
both the good and the bad, the right and the wrong. It can either
incline to the right or incline to the wrong. If we plant any kind of
trees at all close together, the trees which mature later will branch
away from the bigger tree. How does this happen? Who determines it thus?
This is nature, or Dhamma.</p>

<p>Likewise, <em>taṇhā</em> leads us to suffering. Now, if we contemplate it, it
will lead us out of desire, we will outgrow <em>taṇhā</em>. By investigating
<em>taṇhā</em> we will shake it up, making it gradually lighter and lighter
until it’s all gone. The same as the trees: does anybody order them to
grow the way they do? They can’t talk or move around and yet they know
how to grow away from obstacles. Wherever it’s cramped and crowded and
growing is difficult, they bend outwards.</p>

<p>Right here is Dhamma, we don’t have to look at a whole lot. One who is
astute will see the Dhamma in this. Trees by nature don’t know anything,
they act on natural laws, yet they do know enough to grow away from
danger, to incline towards a suitable place.</p>

<p>Reflective people are like this. We go forth into the homeless life
because we want to transcend suffering. What is it that makes us suffer?
If we follow the trail inwards we will find out. That which we like and
that which we don’t like are suffering. If they are suffering then don’t
go so close to them. Do you want to fall in love with conditions or hate
them? They’re all uncertain. When we incline towards the Buddha all this
comes to an end. Don’t forget this. And patient endurance. Just these
two are enough. If you have this sort of understanding this is very
good.</p>

<p>Actually in my own practice I didn’t have a teacher to give as much
teachings as all of you get from me. I didn’t have many teachers. I
ordained in an ordinary village temple and lived in village temples for
quite a few years. In my mind I conceived the desire to practise. I
wanted to be proficient, I wanted to train. There wasn’t anybody giving
any teaching in those monasteries but the inspiration to practise arose.
I travelled and I looked around. I had ears so I listened, I had eyes so
I looked. Whatever I heard people say, I’d tell myself, ‘not sure.’
Whatever I saw, I told myself, ‘not sure,’ or when the tongue contacted
sweet, sour, salty, pleasant or unpleasant flavours, or feelings of
comfort or pain arose in the body, I’d tell myself, ‘This is not a sure
thing!’ And so I lived with Dhamma.</p>

<p>In truth it’s all uncertain, but our desires want things to be certain.
What can we do? We must be patient. The most important thing is
<em>khanti,</em> patient endurance. Don’t throw out the Buddha, what I call
‘uncertainty’ – don’t throw that away.</p>

<p>Sometimes I’d go to see old religious sites with ancient monastic
buildings, designed by architects, built by craftsmen. In some places
they would be cracked. Maybe one of my friends would remark, ‘Such a
shame, isn’t it? It’s cracked.’ I’d answer, ‘If that weren’t the case
then there’d be no such thing as the Buddha, there’d be no Dhamma. It’s
cracked like this because it’s perfectly in line with the Buddha’s
teaching.’ Really down inside I was also sad to see those buildings
cracked but I’d throw off my sentimentality and try to say something
which would be of use to my friends, and to myself. Even though I also
felt that it was a pity, still I tended towards the Dhamma.</p>

<p>‘If it wasn’t cracked like that there wouldn’t be any Buddha!’</p>

<p>I’d say it really heavy for the benefit of my friends, perhaps they
weren’t listening, but still I was listening.</p>

<p>This is a way of considering things which is very, very useful. For
instance, say someone were to rush in and say, ‘Luang Por! Do you know
what so and so just said about you?’ or, ‘He said such and such about
you.’ Maybe you even start to rage. As soon as you hear words of
criticism you start getting these moods every step of the way. As soon
as we hear words like this we may start getting ready to retaliate, but
on looking into the truth of the matter we may find that no, they had
said something else after all.</p>

<p>And so it’s another case of ‘uncertainty’. So why should we rush in and
believe things? Why should we put our trust so much in what others say?
Whatever we hear we should take note of, be patient, look into the
matter carefully and stay straight.</p>

<p>It’s not that we write whatever pops into our heads as some sort of
truth. Any speech which ignores uncertainty is not the speech of a sage.
Remember this. Whatever we see or hear, be it pleasant or sorrowful,
just say ‘this is not sure!’ Say it heavy to yourself, hold it all down
with this. Don’t build those things up into major issues, just keep them
all down to this one. This point is the important one. This is the point
where defilements die. Practitioners shouldn’t dismiss it.</p>

<p>If you disregard this point you can expect only suffering, expect only
mistakes. If you don’t make this a foundation for your practice you are
going to go wrong; but then you will come right again later on, because
this principle is a really good one.</p>

<p>Actually the real Dhamma, the gist of what I have been saying today,
isn’t so mysterious. Whatever you experience is simply form, simply
feeling, simply perception, simply volition, and simply consciousness.
There are only these basic qualities; where is there any certainty
within them?</p>

<p>If we come to understand the true nature of things like this, lust,
infatuation and attachment fade away. Why do they fade away? Because we
understand, we know. We shift from ignorance to understanding.
Understanding is born from ignorance, knowing is born from unknowing,
purity is born from defilement. It works like this.</p>

<p>Not discarding <em>aniccaṃ</em>, the Buddha – this is what it means to say that
the Buddha is still alive. To say that the Buddha has passed into
Nibbāna is not necessarily true. In a more profound sense the Buddha is
still alive. It’s much like how we define the word ‘bhikkhu’. If we
define it as ‘one who asks’,<sup id="fnref_1"><a href="#fn_1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> the meaning is very broad. We can
define it this way, but to use this definition too much is not so good –
we don’t know when to stop asking! If we were to define this word in a
more profound way we would say: ‘Bhikkhu – one who sees the danger of
saṃsāra.’</p>

<p>Isn’t this more profound? It doesn’t go in the same direction as the
previous definition, it runs much deeper. The practice of Dhamma is like
this. If you don’t fully understand it, it becomes something else again.
When it is fully understood, then it becomes priceless, it becomes a
source of peace.</p>

<p>When we have sati, we are close to the Dhamma. If we have sati we will
see <em>aniccaṃ</em>, the transience of all things. We will see the Buddha and
transcend the suffering of saṃsāra, if not now, then sometime in the
future.</p>

<p>If we throw away the attribute of the Noble Ones, the Buddha or the
Dhamma, our practice will become barren and fruitless. We must maintain
our practice constantly, whether we are working or sitting or simply
lying down. When the eye sees form, the ear hears sound, the nose smells
an odour, the tongue tastes a flavour or the body experiences sensation
– in all things, don’t throw away the Buddha, don’t stray from the
Buddha.</p>

<p>This is how to be one who has come close to the Buddha, to be one who
reveres the Buddha constantly. We have ceremonies for revering the
Buddha, such as chanting in the morning, <em>Arahaṃ Sammā Sambuddho
Bhagavā</em> …. This is one way of revering the Buddha but it’s not revering
the Buddha in such a profound way as I’ve described here. It’s the same
with the word ‘bhikkhu’. If we define it as ‘one who asks’ then they
keep on asking because it’s defined like that. To define it in the best
way we should say ‘Bhikkhu – one who sees the danger of saṃsāra.’</p>

<p>Revering the Buddha is the same. Revering the Buddha by merely reciting
Pāḷi phrases as a ceremony in the mornings and evenings is comparable to
defining the word ‘bhikkhu’ as ‘one who asks’. If we incline towards
<em>annicaṃ</em>, <em>dukkhaṃ</em> and <em>anattā</em><sup id="fnref_2"><a href="#fn_2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> whenever the eye sees form, the
ear hears sound, the nose smells an odour, the tongue tastes a flavour,
the body experiences sensation or the mind cognizes mental impressions;
at all times, this is comparable to defining the word ‘bhikkhu’ as ‘one
who sees the danger of saṃsāra.’ It’s so much more profound, cuts
through so many things. If we understand this teaching we will grow in
wisdom and understanding.</p>

<p>This is called <em>paṭipadā.</em> Develop this attitude in the practice and you
will be on the right path. If you think and reflect in this way, even
though you may be far from your teacher you will still be close to him.
If you live close to the teacher physically but your mind has not yet
met him you will spend your time either looking for his faults or
adulating him. If he does something which suits you, you say he’s so
good – and that’s as far as your practice goes. You won’t achieve
anything by wasting your time looking at someone else. But if you
understand this teaching you can become a Noble One in the present
moment.</p>

<p>That’s why this year<sup id="fnref_3"><a href="#fn_3" class="footnote">3</a></sup> I’ve distanced myself from my disciples, both
old and new, and not given much teaching: so that you can all look into
things for yourselves as much as possible. For the newer monks I’ve
already laid down the schedule and rules of the monastery, such as:
‘Don’t talk too much.’ Don’t transgress the existing standards, the path
to realization, fruition and Nibbāna. Anyone who transgresses these
standards is not a real practitioner, not one who has a pure intention
to practise. What can such a person ever hope to see? Even if he slept
near me every day he wouldn’t see me. Even if he slept near the Buddha
he wouldn’t see the Buddha, if he didn’t practise.</p>

<p>So knowing the Dhamma or seeing the Dhamma depends on practice. Have
confidence, purify your own heart. If all the monks in this monastery
put awareness into their respective minds we wouldn’t have to reprimand
or praise anybody. We wouldn’t have to be suspicious of or favour
anybody. If anger or dislike arise just leave them at the mind, but see
them clearly!</p>

<p>Keep on looking at those things. As long as there is still something
there it means we still have to dig and grind away right there. Some
say, ‘I can’t cut it, I can’t do it’ – if we start saying things like
this there will only be a bunch of thugs here, because nobody cuts at
their own defilements.</p>

<p>You must try. If you can’t yet cut it, dig in deeper. Dig at the
defilements, uproot them. Dig them out even if they seem hard and fast.
The Dhamma is not something to be reached by following your desires.
Your mind may be one way, the truth another. You must watch up front and
keep a lookout behind as well. That’s why I say, ‘It’s all uncertain,
all transient.’</p>

<p>This truth of uncertainty, this short and simple truth, is at the same
time so profound and faultless that people tend to ignore it. They tend
to see things differently. Don’t cling to goodness, don’t cling to
badness. These are attributes of the world. We are practising to be free
of the world, so bring these things to an end. The Buddha taught to lay
them down, to give them up, because they only cause suffering.</p>
