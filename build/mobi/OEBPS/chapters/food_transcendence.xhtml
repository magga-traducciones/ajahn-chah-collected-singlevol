<p><span class="dropcaps-first">W</span><span class="dropcaps-words">hen the group</span>  of
five ascetics<sup id="fnref_1"><a href="#fn_1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> abandoned the Buddha, he saw it as a stroke of luck,
because he would be able to continue his practice unhindered. With the
five ascetics living with him, things weren’t so peaceful, he had
responsibilities. And now the five ascetics had abandoned him because
they felt that he had slackened his practice and reverted to indulgence.
Previously he had been intent on his ascetic practices and
self-mortification. In regards to eating, sleeping and so on, he had
tormented himself severely, but it came to a point where, looking into
it honestly, he saw that such practices just weren’t working. It was
simply a matter of views, practising out of pride and clinging. He had
mistaken worldly values and mistaken himself for the truth.</p>

<p>For example, if one decides to throw oneself into ascetic practices with
the intention of gaining praise – this kind of practice is all
‘world-inspired’, practising for adulation and fame. Practising with
this kind of intention is called ‘mistaking worldly ways for truth’.</p>

<p>Another way to practise is ‘to mistake one’s own views for truth’. You
only believe in yourself, in your own practice. No matter what others
say you stick to your own preferences. You don’t carefully consider the
practice. This is called ‘mistaking oneself for truth’.</p>

<p>Whether you take the world or take yourself to be truth, it’s all simply
blind attachment. The Buddha saw this, and saw that there was no
‘adhering to the Dhamma’, practising for the truth. So his practice had
been fruitless, he still hadn’t given up defilements.</p>

<p>Then he turned around and reconsidered all the work he had put into
practice right from the beginning in terms of results. What were the
results of all that practice? Looking deeply into it he saw that it just
wasn’t right. It was full of conceit, and full of the world. There was
no Dhamma, no insight into not-self, <em>anattā,</em> no emptiness or letting
go. There may have been letting go of a kind, but it was the kind that
still hadn’t let go.</p>

<p>Looking carefully at the situation, the Buddha saw that even if he were
to explain these things to the five ascetics they wouldn’t be able to
understand. It wasn’t something he could easily convey to them, because
those ascetics were still firmly entrenched in the old way of practice
and seeing things. The Buddha saw that you could practise like that
until your dying day, maybe even starve to death, and achieve nothing,
because such practice is inspired by worldly values and by pride.</p>

<p>Considering deeply, he saw the right practice, <em>sammā-paṭipadā</em>: the
mind is the mind, the body is the body. The body isn’t desire or
defilement. Even if you were to destroy the body you wouldn’t destroy
defilements. That’s not their source. Even fasting and going without
sleep until the body was a shrivelled-up wraith wouldn’t exhaust the
defilements. But the belief that defilements could be dispelled in that
way, the teaching of self-mortification, was deeply ingrained into the
five ascetics.</p>

<p>The Buddha then began to take more food, eating as normal, practising in
a more natural way. When the five ascetics saw the change in the
Buddha’s practice they figured that he had given up and reverted to
sensual indulgence. One person’s understanding was shifting to a higher
level, transcending appearances, while the other saw that that person’s
view was sliding downwards, reverting to comfort. Self-mortification was
deeply ingrained into the minds of the five ascetics because the Buddha
had previously taught and practised like that. Now he saw the fault in
it. By seeing the fault in it clearly, he was able to let it go.</p>

<p>When the five ascetics saw the Buddha doing this they left him, feeling
that because he was practising wrongly they would no longer follow him.
Just as birds abandon a tree which no longer offers sufficient shade, or
fish leave a pool of water that is too small, too dirty or not cool,
just so did the five ascetics abandon the Buddha.</p>

<p>So now the Buddha concentrated on contemplating the Dhamma. He ate more
comfortably and lived more naturally. He let the mind be simply the
mind, the body simply the body. He didn’t force his practice in excess,
just enough to loosen the grip of greed, aversion, and delusion.
Previously he had walked the two extremes: <em>kāmasukhallikānuyogo</em> – if
happiness or love arose he would be aroused and attach to them. He would
identify with them and he wouldn’t let go. If he encountered
pleasantness he would stick to that, if he encountered suffering he
would stick to that. These two extremes he called <em>kāmasukhallikānuyogo</em>
and <em>attakilamathānuyogo</em>.</p>

<p>The Buddha had been stuck on conditions. He saw clearly that these two
ways are not the way for a <em>samaṇa.</em> Clinging to happiness, clinging to
suffering: a <em>samaṇa</em> is not like this. To cling to those things is not
the way. Clinging to those things he was stuck in the views of self and
the world. If he were to flounder in these two ways he would never
become one who clearly knew the world. He would be constantly running
from one extreme to the other. Now the Buddha fixed his attention on the
mind itself and concerned himself with training that.</p>

<p>All facets of nature proceed according to their supporting conditions;
they aren’t any problem in themselves. For instance, illnesses in the
body. The body experiences pain, sickness, fever and colds and so on.
These all naturally occur. Actually people worry about their bodies too
much. They worry about and cling to their bodies so much because of
wrong view, they can’t let go.</p>

<p>Look at this hall here. We build the hall and say it’s ours, but lizards
come and live here, rats and geckos come and live here, and we are
always driving them away, because we see that the hall belongs to us,
not the rats and lizards.</p>

<p>It’s the same with illnesses in the body. We take this body to be our
home, something that really belongs to us. If we happen to get a
headache or stomach-ache we get upset, we don’t want the pain and
suffering. These legs are ‘our legs’, we don’t want them to hurt, these
arms are ‘our arms’, we don’t want anything to go wrong with them. We’ve
got to cure all pains and illnesses at all costs.</p>

<p>This is where we are fooled and stray from the truth. We are simply
visitors to this body. Just like this hall here, it’s not really ours.
We are simply temporary tenants, like the rats, lizards and geckos – but
we don’t know this. This body is the same. Actually the Buddha taught
that there is no abiding self within this body, but we go and grasp on
to it as being our self, as really being ‘us’ and ‘them’. When the body
changes we don’t want it to do so. No matter how much we are told, we
don’t understand. If I say it straight you get even more fooled. ‘This
isn’t yourself,’ I say, and you go even more astray, you get even more
confused and your practice just reinforces the self.</p>

<p>So most people don’t really see the self. One who sees the self is one
who sees that ‘this is neither the self nor belonging to self’. He sees
the self as it is in nature. Seeing the self through the power of
clinging is not real seeing. Clinging interferes with the whole
business. It’s not easy to realize this body as it is because <em>upādāna</em>
clings fast to it all.</p>

<p>Therefore it is said that we must investigate to clearly know with
wisdom. This means to investigate the <em>saṅkhārā</em> according to their true
nature, use wisdom. Knowing the true nature of <em>saṅkhārā</em> is wisdom. If
you don’t know the true nature of <em>saṅkhārā</em> you are at odds with them,
always resisting them. Now, it is better to let go of the <em>saṅkhārā</em>
than to try to oppose or resist them. And yet we plead with them to
comply with our wishes. We look for all sorts of means to organize them
or ‘make a deal’ with them. If the body gets sick and is in pain we
don’t want it to be, so we look for various suttas to chant, such as
<em>Bojjhaṅgo</em>, the <em>Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta</em>, the <em>Anattalakkhaṇa
Sutta</em> and so on. We don’t want the body to be in pain, we want to
protect it, control it. These suttas become some form of mystical
ceremony, getting us even more entangled in clinging. This is because
they chant them in order to ward off illness, to prolong life and so on.
Actually the Buddha gave us these teachings in order to see clearly, but
we end up chanting them to increase our delusion. <em>Rūpaṃ aniccaṃ, vedanā
aniccā, saññā aniccā, saṅkhārā aniccā, viññānaṃ aniccaṃ</em>.<sup id="fnref_2"><a href="#fn_2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> We don’t
chant these words for increasing our delusion. They are recollections to
help us know the truth of the body, so that we can let it go and give up
our longing.</p>

<p>This is called chanting to cut things down, but we tend to chant in
order to extend them all, or if we feel they’re too long we try chanting
to shorten them, to force nature to conform to our wishes. It’s all
delusion. All the people sitting there in the hall are deluded, every
one of them. The ones chanting are deluded, the ones listening are
deluded, they’re all deluded! All they can think is, ‘How can we avoid
suffering?’ When are they ever going to practise?</p>

<p>Whenever illnesses arise, those who know see nothing strange about it.
Getting born into this world entails experiencing illness. However, even
the Buddha and the Noble Ones, contracting illness in the course of
things, would also, in the course of things, treat it with medicine. For
them it was simply a matter of correcting the elements. They didn’t
blindly cling to the body or grasp at mystic ceremonies and such. They
treated illnesses with right view, they didn’t treat them with delusion.
‘If it heals, it heals, if it doesn’t then it doesn’t’ – that’s how they
saw things.</p>

<p>They say that nowadays Buddhism in Thailand is thriving, but it looks to
me like it’s sunk almost as far as it can go. The Dhamma Halls are full
of attentive ears, but they’re attending wrongly. Even the senior
members of the community are like this; so everybody just leads each
other into more delusion.</p>

<p>One who sees this will know that the true practice is almost opposite
from where most people are going; the two sides can barely understand
each other. How are those people going to transcend suffering? They have
chants for realizing the truth but they turn around and use them to
increase their delusion. They turn their backs on the right path. One
goes eastward, the other goes west – how are they ever going to meet?
They’re not even close to each other.</p>

<p>If you have looked into this you will see that this is the case. Most
people are lost. But how can you tell them? Everything has become rites
and rituals and mystic ceremonies. They chant but they chant with
foolishness, they don’t chant with wisdom. They study, but they study
with foolishness, not with wisdom. They know, but they know foolishly,
not with wisdom. So they end up going with foolishness, living with
foolishness, knowing with foolishness. That’s how it is. And regarding
teaching, all they do these days is teach people to be stupid. They say
they’re teaching people to be clever, giving them knowledge, but when
you look at it in terms of truth, you see that they’re really teaching
people to go astray and grasp at deceptions.</p>

<p>The real foundation of the teaching is in order to see <em>attā</em>, the sense
of self, as being empty, having no fixed identity. It’s void of
intrinsic being. But people come to the study of Dhamma to increase
their self-view; they don’t want to experience suffering or difficulty.
They want everything to be cosy. They may want to transcend suffering,
but if there is still a self how can they ever do so?</p>

<p>Suppose we came to possess a very expensive object. The minute that
thing comes into our possession our mind changes. ‘Now, where can I keep
it? If I leave it there somebody might steal it.’ We worry ourselves
into a state, trying to find a place to keep it. And when did the mind
change? It changed the minute we obtained that object – suffering arose
right then. No matter where we leave that object we can’t relax, so
we’re left with trouble. Whether sitting, walking, or lying down, we are
lost in worry.</p>

<p>This is suffering. And when did it arise? It arose as soon as we
understood that we had obtained something, that’s where the suffering
lies. Before we had that object there was no suffering. It hadn’t yet
arisen because there wasn’t yet an object for us to cling to.</p>

<p><em>Attā</em>, the self, is the same. If we think in terms of ‘my self’, then
everything around us becomes ‘mine’. Confusion follows. Why so? The
cause of it all is that there is a self; we don’t peel off the apparent
in order to see the transcendent. You see, the self is only an
appearance. You have to peel away the appearances in order to see the
heart of the matter, which is transcendence. Upturn the apparent to find
the transcendent.</p>

<p>You could compare it to unthreshed rice. Can unthreshed rice be eaten?
Sure it can, but you must thresh it first. Get rid of the husks and you
will find the grain inside. Now if we don’t thresh the husks we won’t
find the grain. Like a dog sleeping on the pile of unthreshed grain. Its
stomach is rumbling ‘jork-jork-jork,’ but all it can do is lie there,
thinking, ‘Where can I get something to eat?’ When it’s hungry it bounds
off the pile of rice grain and runs off looking for scraps of food. Even
though it’s sleeping right on top of a pile of food it knows nothing of
it. Why? It can’t see the rice. Dogs can’t eat unthreshed rice. The food
is there but the dog can’t eat it.</p>

<p>We may have learning but if we don’t practise accordingly we still don’t
really know; we are just as oblivious as the dog sleeping on the pile of
rice grain. It’s sleeping on a pile of food but it knows nothing of it.
When it gets hungry it’s got to jump off and go trotting around
elsewhere for food. It’s a shame, isn’t it? There is rice grain but what
is hiding it? The husk hides the grain, so the dog can’t eat it. And
there is the transcendent. What hides it? The apparent conceals the
transcendent, making people simply ‘sit on top of the pile of rice,
unable to eat it,’ unable to practise, unable to see the transcendent.
And so they simply get stuck in appearances time and again. If you are
stuck in appearances, suffering is in store. You will be beset by
becoming, birth, old age, sickness and death.</p>

<p>So there isn’t anything else blocking people off, they are blocked right
here. People who study the Dhamma without penetrating to its true
meaning are just like the dog on the pile of unthreshed rice who doesn’t
know the rice. He might even starve and still find nothing to eat. A dog
can’t eat unthreshed rice, it doesn’t even know there is food there.
After a long time without food it may even die, on top of that pile of
rice! People are like this. No matter how much we study the Dhamma of
the Buddha we won’t see it if we don’t practise. If we don’t see it,
then we don’t know it.</p>

<p>Don’t go thinking that by learning a lot and knowing a lot you’ll know
the Buddha Dhamma. That’s like saying you’ve seen everything there is to
see just because you’ve got eyes, or that you’ve got ears. You may see
but you don’t see fully. You see only with the ‘outer eye’, not with the
‘inner eye’; you hear with the ‘outer ear’, not with the ‘inner ear’.</p>

<p>If you upturn the apparent and reveal the transcendent, you will reach
the truth and see clearly. You will uproot the apparent and uproot
clinging.</p>

<p>But this is like some sort of sweet fruit: even though the fruit is
sweet we must rely on contact with and experience of that fruit before
we will know what the taste is like. Now that fruit, even though no-one
tastes it, is sweet all the same. But nobody knows of it. The Dhamma of
the Buddha is like this. Even though it’s the truth it isn’t true for
those who don’t really know it. No matter how excellent or fine it may
be it is worthless to them.</p>

<p>So why do people grab after suffering? Who in this world wants to
inflict suffering on themselves? No one, of course. Nobody wants
suffering and yet people keep creating the causes of suffering, just as
if they were wandering around looking for suffering. Within their hearts
people are looking for happiness, they don’t want suffering. Then why is
it that this mind of ours creates so much suffering? Just seeing this
much is enough. We don’t like suffering and yet why do we create
suffering for ourselves? It’s easy to see, it can only be because we
don’t know suffering, we don’t know the end of suffering. That’s why
people behave the way they do. How could they not suffer when they
continue to behave in this way?</p>

<p>These people have <em>micchā-diṭṭhi</em><sup id="fnref_3"><a href="#fn_3" class="footnote">3</a></sup> but they don’t see that it’s
<em>micchā-diṭṭhi</em>. Whatever we say, believe in or do which results in
suffering is all wrong view. If it wasn’t wrong view it wouldn’t result
in suffering; we couldn’t cling to suffering, nor to happiness or to any
condition at all. We would leave things be their natural way, like a
flowing stream of water. We don’t have to dam it up, we should just let
it flow along its natural course.</p>

<p>The flow of Dhamma is like this, but the flow of the ignorant mind tries
to resist the Dhamma in the form of wrong view. Suffering is there
because of wrong view – this people don’t see. This is worth looking
into. Whenever we have wrong view we will experience suffering. If we
don’t experience it in the present it will manifest later on.</p>

<p>People go astray right here. What is blocking them off? The apparent
blocks off the transcendent, preventing people from seeing things
clearly. People study, they learn, they practise, but they practise with
ignorance, just like a person who’s lost his bearings. He walks to the
west but thinks he’s walking east, or walks to the north thinking he’s
walking south. This is how far people have gone astray. This kind of
practice is really only the dregs of practice, in fact it’s a disaster.
It’s a disaster because they turn around and go in the opposite
direction, they fall from the objective of true Dhamma practice.</p>

<p>This state of affairs causes suffering and yet people think that doing
this, memorizing that, studying such-and-such will be a cause for the
cessation of suffering. Just like a person who wants a lot of things. He
tries to amass as much as possible, thinking if he gets enough his
suffering will abate. This is how people think, but their thinking goes
astray of the true path, just like one person going northward, another
going southward, and yet both believing they’re going the same way.</p>

<p>Most people are still stuck in the mass of suffering, still wandering in
saṃsāra, just because they think like this. If illness or pain arise,
all they can do is wonder how they can get rid of it. They want it to
stop as fast as possible, they’ve got to cure it at all costs. They
don’t consider that this is the normal way of <em>saṅkhārā</em>. Nobody thinks
like this. The body changes and people can’t endure it, they can’t
accept it, they’ve got to get rid of it at all costs. However, in the
end they can’t win, they can’t beat the truth. It all collapses. This is
something people don’t want to look at, they continually reinforce their
wrong view.</p>

<p>Practising to realize the Dhamma is the most excellent of things. Why
did the Buddha develop all the Perfections? So that he could realize
this and enable others to see the Dhamma, know the Dhamma, practise the
Dhamma and be the Dhamma – so that they could let go and not be
burdened.</p>

<p>‘Don’t cling to things.’ Or to put it another way: ‘Hold, but don’t hold
fast.’ This is also right. If we see something we pick it up, ‘oh, it’s
this’; then we lay it down. We see something else, pick it up and hold
it, but not fast. We hold it just long enough to consider it, to know
it, then to let it go. If you hold without letting go, carry without
laying down the burden, then you are going to be heavy. If you pick
something up and carry it for a while, then when it gets heavy you
should lay it down, throw it off. Don’t make suffering for yourself.</p>

<p>This we should know as the cause of suffering. If we know the cause of
suffering, suffering can not arise. For either happiness or suffering to
arise there must be the <em>attā</em>, the self. There must be the ‘I’ and
‘mine’, there must be this appearance. If when all these things arise
the mind goes straight to the transcendent, it removes the appearances.
It removes the delight, the aversion and the clinging from those things.
Just as when something that we value gets lost, when we find it again
our worries disappear.</p>

<p>Even before we see that object our worries may be relieved. At first we
think it’s lost and suffer over it, but there comes a day when we
suddenly remember, ‘Oh, that’s right! I put it over there, now I
remember!’ As soon as we remember this, as soon as we see the truth,
even if we haven’t laid eyes on that object, we feel happy. This is
called ‘seeing within’, seeing with the mind’s eye, not seeing with the
outer eye. If we see with the mind’s eye then even though we haven’t
laid eyes on that object we are already relieved.</p>

<p>Similarly, when we cultivate Dhamma practice and attain the Dhamma, see
the Dhamma, then whenever we encounter a problem we solve the problem
instantly, right then and there. It disappears completely, it is laid
down, released.</p>

<p>The Buddha wanted us to contact the Dhamma, but people only contact the
words, the books and the scriptures. This is contacting that which is
about Dhamma, not contacting the actual Dhamma as taught by our great
teacher. How can people say they are practising well and properly? They
are a long way off.</p>

<p>The Buddha was known as <em>lokavidū,</em> having clearly realized the world.
Right now we see the world all right, but not clearly. The more we know
the darker the world becomes, because our knowledge is murky, it’s not
clear knowledge. It’s faulty. This is called ‘knowing through darkness’,
lacking in light and radiance.</p>

<p>People are only stuck here but it’s no trifling matter. It’s important.
Most people want goodness and happiness but they just don’t know what
the causes for that goodness and happiness are. Whatever it may be, if
we haven’t yet seen the harm of it we can’t give it up. No matter how
bad it may be, we still can’t give it up if we haven’t truly seen the
harm of it. However, if we really see the harm of something beyond a
doubt, then we can let it go. As soon as we see the harm of something,
and the benefit of giving it up, there’s an immediate change.</p>

<p>Why is it we are still unattained, still can not let go? It’s because we
still don’t see the harm clearly, our knowledge is faulty, it’s dark.
That’s why we can’t let go. If we knew clearly like the Lord Buddha or
the arahant disciples we would surely let go, our problems would
dissolve completely with no difficulty at all.</p>

<p>When your ears hear sound, let them do their job. When your eyes perform
their function with forms, let them do so. When your nose works with
smells, let it do its job. When your body experiences sensations, then
it perform its natural functions. Where will problems arise? There are
no problems.</p>

<p>In the same way, all those things which belong to the apparent, leave
them with the apparent and acknowledge that which is the transcendent.
Simply be the ‘one who knows’, knowing without fixation, knowing and
letting things be their natural way. All things are just as they are.</p>

<p>All our belongings, does anybody really own them? Does our father own
them, or our mother, or our relatives? Nobody really gets anything.
That’s why the Buddha said to let all those things be, let them go. Know
them clearly. Know them by holding, but not fast. Use things in a way
that is beneficial, not in a harmful way by holding fast to them until
suffering arises.</p>

<p>To know Dhamma you must know in this way. That is, to know in such a way
as to transcend suffering. This sort of knowledge is important. Knowing
about how to make things, to use tools, knowing all the various sciences
of the world and so on, all have their place, but they are not the
supreme knowledge. The Dhamma must be known as I’ve explained it here.
You don’t have to know a whole lot, just this much is enough for the
Dhamma practitioner – to know and then let go.</p>

<p>It’s not that you have to die before you can transcend suffering, you
know. You transcend suffering in this very life because you know how to
solve problems. You know the apparent, you know the transcendent. Do it
in this lifetime, while you are here practising. You won’t find it
anywhere else. Don’t cling to things. Hold, but don’t cling.</p>

<p>You may wonder, ‘Why does the Ajahn keep saying this?’ How could I teach
otherwise, how could I say otherwise, when the truth is just as I’ve
said it? Even though it’s the truth don’t hold fast to even that! If you
cling to it blindly it becomes a falsehood. Like a dog if you grab its
leg. If you don’t let go the dog will spin around and bite you. Just try
it out. All animals behave like this. If you don’t let go it’s got no
choice but to bite. The apparent is the same. We live in accordance with
conventions. They are here for our convenience in this life, but they
are not things to be clung to so hard that they cause suffering. Just
let things pass.</p>

<p>Whenever we feel that we are definitely right, so much so that we refuse
to open up to anything or anybody else, right there we are wrong. It
becomes wrong view. When suffering arises, where does it arise from? The
cause is wrong view, the fruit of that being suffering. If it was right
view it wouldn’t cause suffering.</p>

<p>So I say, ‘Allow space, don’t cling to things.’ ‘Right’ is just another
supposition; just let it pass. ‘Wrong’ is another apparent condition;
just let it be that. If you feel you are right and yet others contend
the issue, don’t argue, just let it go. As soon as you know, let go.
This is the straight way.</p>

<p>Usually it’s not like this. People don’t often give in to each other.
That’s why some people, even Dhamma practitioners who still don’t know
themselves, may say things that are utter foolishness and yet think
they’re being wise. They may say something that’s so stupid that others
can’t even bear to listen and yet they think they are being cleverer
than others. Other people can’t even listen to it and yet they think
they are smart, that they are right. They are simply advertising their
own stupidity.</p>

<p>That’s why the wise say, ‘Whatever speech disregards <em>aniccaṃ</em> is not
the speech of a wise person, it’s the speech of a fool. It’s deluded
speech. It’s the speech of one who doesn’t know that suffering is going
to arise right there.’</p>

<p>For example, suppose you had decided to go to Bangkok tomorrow and
someone were to ask, ‘Are you going to Bangkok tomorrow?’ ‘I hope to go
to Bangkok. If there are no obstacles I’ll probably go.’ This is called
speaking with the Dhamma in mind, speaking with <em>aniccaṃ</em> in mind,
taking into account the truth, the transient, uncertain nature of the
world. You don’t say, ‘Yes, I’m definitely going tomorrow.’ If it turns
out you don’t go, what are you going to do, send news to all the people
who you told you were going? You’d be just talking nonsense.</p>

<p>There’s still much more to the practice of Dhamma; it becomes more and
more refined. But if you don’t see it, you may think you are speaking
right even when you are speaking wrongly and straying from the true
nature of things with every word. And yet you may think you are speaking
the truth. To put it simply: anything that we say or do that causes
suffering to arise should be known as <em>micchā-diṭṭhi</em>. It’s delusion and
foolishness.</p>

<p>Most practitioners don’t reflect in this way. Whatever they like, they
think is right and they just go on believing themselves. For instance,
they may receive some gift or title, be it an object, rank or even words
of praise, and they think it’s good. They take it as some sort of
permanent condition. So they get puffed up with pride and conceit, they
don’t consider, ‘Who am I? Where is this so-called ‘goodness?’ Where did
it come from? Do others have the same things?’</p>

<p>The Buddha taught that we should conduct ourselves normally. If we don’t
dig in, chew over and look into this point, it means it’s still sunk
within us. It means these conditions are still buried within our hearts
– we are still sunk in wealth, rank and praise. So we become someone
else because of them. We think we are better than before, that we are
something special and so all sorts of confusion arises.</p>

<p>Actually, in truth there isn’t anything to human beings. Whatever we may
be it’s only in the realm of appearances. If we take away the apparent
and see the transcendent we see that there isn’t anything there. There
are simply the universal characteristics – birth in the beginning,
change in the middle and cessation in the end. This is all there is. If
we see that all things are like this, then no problems arise. If we
understand this we will have contentment and peace.</p>

<p>Where trouble arises is when we think like the five ascetic disciples of
the Buddha. They followed the instruction of their teacher, but when he
changed his practice they couldn’t understand what he thought or knew.
They decided that the Buddha had given up his practice and reverted to
indulgence. If we were in that position we’d probably think the same
thing and there’d be no way to correct it. We’d be holding on to the old
ways, thinking in the lower way, yet believing it’s higher. We’d see the
Buddha and think he’d given up the practice and reverted to indulgence,
just like those five ascetics: consider how many years they had been
practising at that time, and yet they still went astray, they still
weren’t proficient.</p>

<p>So I say to practise and also to look at the results of your practice.
Look especially where you refuse to follow, where there is friction.
Where there is no friction, there is no problem, things flow. If there
is friction, they don’t flow; you set up a self and things become solid,
like a mass of clinging. There is no give and take.</p>

<p>Most monks and cultivators tend to be like this. However they’ve thought
in the past they continue to think. They refuse to change, they don’t
reflect. They think they are right so they can’t be wrong, but actually
‘wrongness’ is buried within ‘rightness’, even though most people don’t
know that. How is it so? ‘This is right’ … but if someone else says it’s
not right you won’t give in, you’ve got to argue. What is this?
<em>Diṭṭhi-māna</em>. <em>Diṭṭhi</em> means views, <em>māna</em> is the attachment to those
views. If we attach even to what is right, refusing to concede to
anybody, then it becomes wrong. To cling fast to rightness is simply the
arising of self, there is no letting go.</p>

<p>This is a point which gives people a lot of trouble, except for those
Dhamma practitioners who know that this matter, this point, is a very
important one. They will take note of it. If it arises while they’re
speaking, clinging comes racing on to the scene. Maybe it will linger
for some time, perhaps one or two days, three or four months, a year or
two. This is for the slow ones, that is. For the quick, response is
instant – they just let go. Clinging arises and immediately there is
letting go, they force the mind to let go right then and there.</p>

<p>You must see these two functions operating. Here there is clinging. Now
who is the one who resists that clinging? Whenever you experience a
mental impression you should observe these two functions operating.
There is clinging, and there is one who prohibits the clinging. Now just
watch these two things. Maybe you will cling for a long time before you
let go.</p>

<p>Reflecting and constantly practising like this, clinging gets lighter,
it becomes less and less. Right view increases as wrong view gradually
wanes. Clinging decreases, non-clinging arises. This is the way it is
for everybody. That’s why I say to consider this point. Learn to solve
problems in the present moment.</p>
