<p><span class="dropcaps-first">T</span><span class="dropcaps-words">he teaching of
Buddhism</span>  is about giving up evil and practising good.
Then, when evil is given up and goodness is established, we must let go
of both good and evil. We have already heard enough about wholesome and
unwholesome conditions to understand something about them, so I would
like to talk about the Middle Way, that is, the path to transcend both
of those things.</p>

<p>All the Dhamma talks and teachings of the Buddha have one aim – to show
the way out of suffering to those who have not yet escaped. The
teachings are for the purpose of giving us the right understanding. If
we don’t understand rightly, then we can’t arrive at peace.</p>

<p>When all the Buddhas became enlightened and gave their first teachings,
they pointed out these two extremes – indulgence in pleasure and
indulgence in pain. These two types of infatuation are the opposite
poles between which those who indulge in sense pleasures must fluctuate,
never arriving at peace. They are the paths which spin around in
saṃsāra.</p>

<p>The Enlightened One observed that all beings are stuck in these two
extremes, never seeing the Middle Way of Dhamma, so he pointed them out
in order to show the penalty involved in both. Because we are still
stuck, because we are still wanting, we live repeatedly under their
sway. The Buddha declared that these two ways are the ways of
intoxication, they are not the ways of a meditator, not the ways to
peace. These ways are indulgence in pleasure and indulgence in pain, or,
to put it simply, the way of slackness and the way of tension.</p>

<p>If you investigate within, moment by moment, you will see that the tense
way is anger, the way of sorrow. Going this way there is only difficulty
and distress. If you’ve transcended indulgence in pleasure it means
you’ve transcended happiness. Happiness and unhappiness, are not
peaceful states. The Buddha taught to let go of both of them. This is
right practice. This is the Middle Way.</p>

<p>These words, ‘the Middle Way’, do not refer to our body and speech, they
refer to the mind. When a mental impression which we don’t like arises,
it affects the mind and there is confusion. When the mind is confused,
when it’s ‘shaken up’, this is not the right way. When a mental
impression arises which we like, the mind goes to indulgence in pleasure
– that’s not the way either.</p>

<p>We people don’t want suffering, we want happiness. But in fact happiness
is just a refined form of suffering. Suffering itself is the coarse
form. You can compare it to a snake. The head of the snake is
unhappiness, the tail of the snake is happiness. The head of the snake
is really dangerous, it has poisonous fangs. If you touch it, the snake
will bite straight away. But never mind the head; even if you go and
hold onto the tail, it will turn around and bite you just the same,
because both the head and the tail belong to the one snake.</p>

<p>In the same way, both happiness and unhappiness, or pleasure and
sadness, arise from the same parent – wanting. So when you’re happy the
mind isn’t peaceful. It really isn’t! For instance, when we get the
things we like, such as wealth, prestige, praise or happiness, we become
pleased as a result. But the mind still harbours some uneasiness because
we’re afraid of losing it. That very fear isn’t a peaceful state. Later
on we may actually lose that thing and then we really suffer.</p>

<p>Thus, if you aren’t aware, even if you’re happy, suffering is imminent.
It’s just the same as grabbing the snake’s tail – if you don’t let go it
will bite. So whether it’s the snake’s tail or its head, that is,
wholesome or unwholesome conditions, they’re all just characteristics of
the ‘Wheel of Existence’, of endless change.</p>

<p>The Buddha established morality, concentration and wisdom as the path to
peace, the way to enlightenment. But in truth these things are not the
essence of Buddhism. They are merely the path. The Buddha called them
<em>magga,</em> which means ‘path’. The essence of Buddhism is peace, and that
peace arises from truly knowing the nature of all things. If we
investigate closely, we can see that peace is neither happiness nor
unhappiness. Neither of these is the truth.</p>

<p>The human mind, the mind which the Buddha exhorted us to know and
investigate, is something we can only know by its activity. The true
‘original mind’ has nothing to measure it by, there’s nothing you can
know it by. In its natural state it is unshaken, unmoving. When
happiness arises all that happens is that this mind gets lost in a
mental impression; there is movement. When the mind moves like this,
clinging and attachment to those things come into being.</p>

<p>The Buddha has already laid down the path of practice in its entirety,
but we have not yet practised, or if we have, we’ve practised only in
speech. Our minds and our speech are not yet in harmony, we just indulge
in empty talk. But the basis of Buddhism is not something that can be
talked about or guessed at. The real basis of Buddhism is full knowledge
of the truth of reality. If one knows this truth then no teaching is
necessary. If one doesn’t know, even if he listens to the teaching, he
doesn’t really hear. This is why the Buddha said, ‘The Enlightened One
only points the way.’ He can’t do the practice for you, because the
truth is something you can not put into words or give away.</p>

<p>All the teachings are merely similes and comparisons, means to help the
mind see the truth. If we haven’t seen the truth we must suffer. For
example, we commonly use the term <em>‘saṅkhārā’</em> when referring to the
body. Anybody can say it, but in fact we have problems simply because we
don’t know the truth of these <em>saṅkhārā</em>, and thus cling to them.
Because we don’t know the truth of the body, we suffer.</p>

<p>Here is an example. Suppose one morning you’re walking to work and a man
yells abuse and insults at you from across the street. As soon as you
hear this abuse your mind changes from its usual state. You don’t feel
so good, you feel angry and hurt. That man walks around abusing you
night and day. Whenever you hear the abuse, you get angry, and even when
you return home you’re still angry because you feel vindictive, you want
to get even.</p>

<p>A few days later another man comes to your house and calls out, ‘Hey!
That man who abused you the other day, he’s mad, he’s crazy! Has been
for years! He abuses everybody like that. Nobody takes any notice of
anything he says.’ As soon as you hear this you are suddenly relieved.
That anger and hurt that you’ve pent up within you all these days melts
away completely. Why? Because you know the truth of the matter now.
Before, you didn’t know, you thought that man was normal, so you were
angry at him. Thinking like that caused you to suffer. As soon as you
find out the truth, everything changes: ‘Oh, he’s mad! That explains
everything!’</p>

<p>When you understand this you feel fine, because you know for yourself.
Having known, then you can let go. If you don’t know the truth you cling
right there. When you thought that man who abused you was normal you
could have killed him. But when you find out the truth, that he’s mad,
you feel much better. This is knowledge of the truth.</p>

<p>Someone who sees the Dhamma has a similar experience. When attachment,
aversion and delusion disappear, they disappear in the same way. As long
as we don’t know these things we think, ‘What can I do? I have so much
greed and aversion.’ This is not clear knowledge. It’s just the same as
when we thought the madman was sane. When we finally see that he was mad
all along we’re relieved of worry. No one could show you this. Only when
the mind sees for itself can it uproot and relinquish attachment.</p>

<p>It’s the same with this body which we call ‘<em>saṅkhārā</em>’. Although the
Buddha has already explained that the body is not substantial or a real
being as such, we still don’t agree, we stubbornly cling to it. If the
body could talk, it would be telling us all day long, ‘You’re not my
owner, you know.’ Actually it’s telling us all the time, but it’s Dhamma
language, so we’re unable to understand it.</p>

<p>For instance, the sense organs of eye, ear, nose, tongue and body are
continually changing, but I’ve never seen them ask permission from us
even once! Like when we have a headache or a stomach ache – the body
never asks permission first, it just goes right ahead, following its
natural course. This shows that the body doesn’t allow anyone to be its
owner, it doesn’t have an owner. The Buddha described it as an object
void of substance.</p>

<p>We don’t understand the Dhamma and so we don’t understand these
‘<em>saṅkhārā</em>’; we take them to be ourselves, as belonging to us or
belonging to others. This gives rise to clinging. When clinging arises,
‘becoming’ follows. Once becoming arises, then there is birth. Once
there is birth, then old age, sickness, death … the whole mass of
suffering arises.</p>

<p>This is the <em>paṭiccasamuppāda.</em> We say ignorance gives rise to
volitional activities, they give rise to consciousness and so on. All
these things are simply events in the mind. When we come into contact
with something we don’t like, if we don’t have mindfulness, ignorance is
there. Suffering arises straight away. But the mind passes through these
changes so rapidly that we can’t keep up with them. It’s the same as
when you fall from a tree. Before you know it – ‘Thud!’ – you’ve hit the
ground. Actually you’ve passed many branches and twigs on the way, but
you couldn’t count them, you couldn’t remember them as you passed them.
You just fall, and then ‘Thud!’</p>

<p>The <em>paṭiccasamuppāda</em> is the same as this. If we divide it up as it is
in the scriptures, we say ignorance gives rise to volitional activities,
volitional activities give rise to consciousness, consciousness gives
rise to mind and matter, mind and matter give rise to the six sense
bases, the sense bases give rise to sense contact, contact gives rise to
feeling, feeling gives rise to wanting, wanting gives rise to clinging,
clinging gives rise to becoming, becoming gives rise to birth, birth
gives rise to old age, sickness, death, and all forms of sorrow. But in
truth, when you come into contact with something you don’t like, there’s
immediate suffering! That feeling of suffering is actually the result of
the whole chain of the <em>paṭiccasamuppāda</em>. This is why the Buddha
exhorted his disciples to investigate and know fully their own minds.</p>

<p>When people are born into the world they are without names – once born,
we name them. This is convention. We give people names for the sake of
convenience, to call each other by. The scriptures are the same. We
separate everything with labels to make studying the reality convenient.
In the same way, all things are simply <em>saṅkhārā</em>. Their original nature
is merely that of compounded things. The Buddha said that they are
impermanent, unsatisfactory and not-self. They are unstable. We don’t
understand this firmly, our understanding is not straight, and so we
have wrong view. This wrong view is that the <em>saṅkhārā</em> are ourselves,
we are the <em>saṅkhārā</em>, or that happiness and unhappiness are ourselves,
we are happiness and unhappiness. Seeing like this is not full, clear
knowledge of the true nature of things. The truth is that we can’t force
all these things to follow our desires, they follow the way of nature.</p>

<p>Here is a simple comparison: suppose you go and sit in the middle of a
freeway with the cars and trucks charging down at you. You can’t get
angry at the cars, shouting, ‘Don’t drive over here! Don’t drive over
here!’ It’s a freeway, you can’t tell them that. So what can you do? You
get off the road! The road is the place where cars run, if you don’t
want the cars to be there, you suffer.</p>

<p>It’s the same with <em>saṅkhārā</em>. We say they disturb us, like when we sit
in meditation and hear a sound. We think, ‘Oh, that sound’s bothering
me.’ If we understand that the sound bothers us then we suffer
accordingly. If we investigate a little deeper, we will see that it’s we
who go out and disturb the sound! The sound is simply sound. If we
understand like this then there’s nothing more to it, we leave it be. We
see that the sound is one thing, we are another. One who understands
that the sound comes to disturb him is one who doesn’t see himself. He
really doesn’t! Once you see yourself, then you’re at ease. The sound is
just sound, why should you go and grab it? You see that actually it was
you who went out and disturbed the sound.</p>

<p>This is real knowledge of the truth. You see both sides, so you have
peace. If you see only one side, there is suffering. Once you see both
sides, then you follow the Middle Way. This is the right practice of the
mind. This is what we call straightening out our understanding.</p>

<p>In the same way, the nature of all <em>saṅkhārā</em> is impermanence and death,
but we want to grab them; we carry them about and covet them. We want
them to be true. We want to find truth within the things that aren’t
true. Whenever someone sees like this and clings to the <em>saṅkhārā</em> as
being himself, he suffers.</p>

<p>The practice of Dhamma is not dependent on being a monk, a novice or a
layman; it depends on straightening out your understanding. If our
understanding is correct, we arrive at peace. Whether you are ordained
or not it’s the same, every person has the chance to practise Dhamma, to
contemplate it. We all contemplate the same thing. If you attain peace,
it’s all the same peace; it’s the same path, with the same methods.</p>

<p>Therefore the Buddha didn’t discriminate between laymen and monks, he
taught all people to practise in order to know the truth of the
<em>saṅkhārā</em>. When we know this truth, we let them go. If we know the
truth there will be no more becoming or birth. How is there no more
birth? There is no way for birth to take place because we fully know the
truth of <em>saṅkhārā</em>. If we fully know the truth, then there is peace.
Having or not having, it’s all the same. Gain and loss are one. The
Buddha taught us to know this. This is peace; peace from happiness,
unhappiness, gladness and sorrow.</p>

<p>We must see that there is no reason to be born. Born in what way? Born
into gladness: when we get something we like we are glad over it. If
there is no clinging to that gladness there is no birth. If there is
clinging, this is called ‘birth’. So if we get something, we aren’t born
into gladness. If we lose something, we aren’t born into sorrow. This is
the birthless and the deathless. Birth and death are both founded in
clinging to and cherishing the <em>saṅkhārā</em>.</p>

<p>So the Buddha said: ‘There is no more becoming for me, finished is the
holy life, this is my last birth.’ There! He knew the birthless and the
deathless. This is what the Buddha constantly exhorted his disciples to
know. This is the right practice. If you don’t reach it, if you don’t
reach the Middle Way, then you won’t transcend suffering.</p>
