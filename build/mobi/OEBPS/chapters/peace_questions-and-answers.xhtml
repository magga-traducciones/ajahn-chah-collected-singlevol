<p class="chapter-footnote"><em>Note:</em> This talk has been
previously published as ‘<em>Questions and Answers</em>’ in ‘<em>The Path to
Peace</em>’</p>

<p><em>Question:</em> There are those periods when our hearts happen to be
absorbed in things and become blemished or darkened, but we are still
aware of ourselves; such as when some form of greed, hatred, or delusion
comes up. Although we know that these things are objectionable, we are
unable to prevent them from arising. Could it be said that even as we
are aware of them, this is providing the basis for increased clinging
and attachment and maybe is putting us further back to where we started
from?</p>

<p><em>Answer:</em> That’s it! One must keep knowing them at that point, that’s
the method of practice.</p>

<p><em>Q:</em> I mean that simultaneously we are both aware of them and repelled
by them, but lacking the ability to resist them, they just burst forth.</p>

<p><em>A:</em> By then, it’s already beyond one’s capability to do anything. At
that point one has to re-adjust oneself and then continue contemplation.
Don’t just give up on them there and then. When one sees things arise in
that way one tends to get upset or feel regret, but it is possible to
say that they are uncertain and subject to change. What happens is that
one sees these things are wrong, but one is still not ready or able to
deal with them. It’s as if they are independent entities, the leftover
karmic tendencies that are still creating and conditioning the state of
the heart. One doesn’t wish to allow the heart to become like that, but
it does and it indicates that one’s knowledge and awareness is still
neither sufficient nor fast enough to keep abreast of things.</p>

<p>One must practise and develop mindfulness as much as one can in order to
gain a greater and more penetrating awareness. Whether the heart is
soiled or blemished in some way, it doesn’t matter, one should
contemplate the impermanence and uncertainty of whatever comes up. By
maintaining this contemplation at each instant that something arises,
after some time one will see the impermanent nature inherent in all
sense objects and mental states. Because one sees them as such,
gradually they will lose their importance and one’s clinging and
attachment to that which is a blemish on the heart will continue to
diminish. Whenever suffering arises one will be able to work through it
and readjust oneself, but one shouldn’t give up on this work or set it
aside. One must keep up a continuity of effort and try to make one’s
awareness fast enough to keep in touch with the changing mental
conditions. It could be said that so far one’s development of the Path
still lacks sufficient energy to overcome the mental defilements.
Whenever suffering arises the heart becomes clouded over, but one must
keep developing that knowledge and understanding of the clouded heart;
that is what one reflects on.</p>

<p>One must really take hold of it and repeatedly contemplate that this
suffering and discontentment is just not a sure thing. It is something
that is ultimately impermanent, unsatisfactory, and not-self. Focusing
on these three characteristics, whenever these conditions of suffering
arise again one will know them straight away, having experienced them
before.</p>

<p>Gradually, little by little, one’s practice should gain momentum and as
time passes, whatever sense objects and mental states arise will lose
their value in this way. One’s heart will know them for what they are
and accordingly put them down. The path has matured internally when,
having reached the point where one is able to know things and put them
down with ease, one will have the ability to swiftly bear down upon the
defilements. From then on there will just be the arising and passing
away in this place, the same as waves striking the seashore. When a wave
comes in and finally reaches the shoreline, it just disintegrates and
vanishes; a new wave comes and it happens again – the wave going no
further than the limit of the shoreline. In the same way, nothing will
be able to go beyond the limits established by one’s own awareness.</p>

<p>That’s the place where one will meet and come to understand
impermanence, unsatisfactoriness and not-self. It is there that things
will vanish – the three characteristics of impermanence,
unsatisfactoriness and not-self are the same as the seashore, and all
sense objects and mental states that are experiences go in the same way
as the waves. Happiness is uncertain, it’s arisen many times before.
Suffering is uncertain, it’s arisen many times before; that’s the way
they are. In one’s heart one will know that they are like that, they are
‘just that much’. The heart will experience these conditions in this way
and they will gradually keep losing their value and importance. This is
talking about the characteristics of the heart, the way it is; it is the
same for everybody, even the Buddha and all his disciples were like
this.</p>

<p>If one’s practice of the Path matures it will become automatic and it
will no longer be dependent on anything external. When a defilement
arises, one will immediately be aware of it and accordingly be able to
counteract it. However, that stage when the Path is still not mature
enough nor fast enough to overcome the defilements is something that
everybody has to experience – it’s unavoidable. But it is at that point
where one must use skilful reflection. Don’t go investigating elsewhere
or trying to solve the problem at some other place. Cure it right there.
Apply the cure at that place where things arise and pass away. Happiness
arises and then passes away, doesn’t it? Suffering arises and then
passes away, doesn’t it? One will continuously be able to see the
process of arising and ceasing, and see that which is good and bad in
the heart. These are phenomena that exist and are part of nature. Don’t
cling tightly to them or create anything out of them at all.</p>

<p>If one has this kind of awareness, then even though one will be coming
into contact with things, there will not be any noise. In other words,
one will see the arising and passing away of phenomena in a very natural
and ordinary way. One will just see things arise and then cease. One
will understand the process of arising and ceasing in the light of
impermanence, unsatisfactoriness, and not-self.</p>

<p>The nature of the Dhamma is like this. When one can see things as ‘just
that much’, then they will remain as ‘just that much’. There will be
none of that clinging or holding on – as soon as one becomes aware of
attachment it will disappear. There will be just the arising and
ceasing, and that is peaceful. That it’s peaceful is not because one
doesn’t hear anything; there is hearing, but one understands the nature
of it and doesn’t cling or hold on to anything. This is what is meant by
peaceful – the heart is still experiencing sense objects, but it doesn’t
follow or get caught up in them. A division is made between the heart’s
sense objects and the defilements. When one’s heart comes into contact
with a sense object and there is an emotional reaction of liking, this
gives rise to defilement; but if one understands the process of arising
and ceasing, there is nothing that can really arise from it – it will
end just there.</p>

<p><em>Q:</em> Does one have to practise and gain samādhi before one can
contemplate the Dhamma?</p>

<p><em>A:</em> One can say that’s correct from one point of view, but talking
about it from the aspect of practice, then paññā has to come first, but
following the conventional framework it has to be sīla, samādhi and then
paññā. If one is truly practising the Dhamma, then paññā comes first. If
paññā is there from the beginning, it means that one knows that which is
right and that which is wrong; and one knows the heart that is calm and
the heart that is disturbed and agitated. Talking from the scriptural
basis, one has to say that the practice of restraint and composure will
give rise to a sense of shame and fear of any form of wrongdoing that
potentially may arise. Once one has established the fear of that which
is wrong and one is no longer acting or behaving wrongly, then that
which is a wrong will not be present within one. When there is no longer
anything wrong present within, this provides the conditions from which
calm will arise in its place. That calm forms a foundation from which
samādhi will grow and develop over time.</p>

<p>When the heart is calm, that knowledge and understanding which arises
from within that calm is called vipassanā. This means that from moment
to moment there is a knowing in accordance with the truth, and within
this are contained different properties. If one was to set them down on
paper they would be sīla, samādhi and paññā. Talking about them, one can
bring them together and say that these three dhammas form one mass and
are inseparable. But if one was to talk about them as different
properties, then it would be correct to say sīla, samādhi and paññā.</p>

<p>However, when one is acting in an unwholesome way, it is impossible for
the heart to become calm. So it is most accurate to see them as
developing together, and it would be right to say that this is the way
that the heart will become calm. The practice of samādhi involves
preserving sīla, which includes looking after the sphere of one’s bodily
actions and speech, in order not to do anything which is unwholesome or
would lead one to remorse or suffering. This provides the foundation for
the practice of calm, and once one has a foundation in calm, this in
turn provides a foundation which supports the arising of paññā.</p>

<p>In formal teaching they emphasize the importance of sīla. <em>Ādikalyāṇa</em>,
<em>majjhekalyāṇa</em>, <em>pariyosānakalyāṇa</em> – the practice should be beautiful
in the beginning, beautiful in the middle and beautiful in the end. This
is how it is. Have you ever practised samādhi?</p>

<p><em>Q:</em> I am still learning. The day after I went to see Tan Ajahn at Wat
Keuan my aunt brought a book containing some of your teachings for me to
read. That morning at work I started to read some passages which
contained questions and answers to different problems. In it you said
that the most important point was for the heart to watch over and
observe the process of cause and effect that takes place within. Just to
watch and maintain the knowing of the different things that come up.</p>

<p>That afternoon I was practising meditation and during the sitting, the
characteristics that appeared were that I felt as though my body had
disappeared. I was unable to feel the hands or legs and there were no
bodily sensations. I knew that the body was still there, but I couldn’t
feel it. In the evening I had the opportunity to go and pay respects to
Tan Ajahn Tate and I described to him the details of my experience. He
said that these were the characteristics of the heart that appear when
it unifies in samādhi, and that I should continue practising. I had this
experience only once; on subsequent occasions I found that sometimes I
was unable to feel only certain areas of the body, such as the hands,
whereas in other areas there was still feeling. Sometimes during my
practice I start to wonder whether just sitting and allowing the heart
to let go of everything is the correct way to practise; or else should I
think about and occupy myself with the different problems or unanswered
questions concerning the Dhamma, which I still have.</p>

<p><em>A:</em> It’s not necessary to keep going over or adding anything on at this
stage. This is what Tan Ajahn Tate was referring to; one must not repeat
or add on to that which is there already. When that particular kind of
knowing is present, it means that the heart is calm and it is that state
of calm which one must observe. Whatever one feels, whether it feels
like there is a body or a self or not, this is not the important point.
It should all come within the field of one’s awareness. These conditions
indicate that the heart is calm and has unified in samādhi.</p>

<p>When the heart has unified for a long period, on a few occasions, then
there will be a change in the conditions and one withdraws. That state
is called <em>appaṇā samādhi</em> (absorption) and having entered, the heart
will subsequently withdraw. In fact, although it would not be incorrect
to say that the heart withdraws, it doesn’t actually withdraw. Another
way is to say that it flips back, or that it changes, but the style used
by most teachers is to say that once the heart has reached the state of
calm it will withdraw. However, people can get caught up in
disagreements over the use of language. It can cause difficulties and
one might start to wonder, ‘how on earth can it withdraw? This business
of withdrawing is just confusing!’ It can lead to much foolishness and
misunderstanding just because of the language.</p>

<p>What one must understand is that the way to practise is to observe these
conditions with <em>sati-sampajañña.</em> In accordance with the characteristic
of impermanence, the heart will turn about and withdraw to the level of
<em>upacāra-samādhi.</em> If it withdraws to this level, one can gain some
knowledge and understanding, because at the deeper level there is not
knowledge and understanding. If there is knowledge and understanding at
this point it will resemble <em>saṅkhārā</em> (thinking).</p>

<p>It’s similar to two people having a conversation and discussing the
Dhamma together. One who understands this might feel disappointed that
their heart is not really calm, but in fact this dialogue takes place
within the confines of the calm and restraint which has developed. These
are the characteristics of the heart once it has withdrawn to the level
of <em>upacāra</em> – there will be the ability to know about and understand
different things.</p>

<p>The heart will stay in this state for a period and then it will turn
inwards again. In other words, it will turn and go back into the deeper
state of calm as it was before; or it is even possible that it might
obtain purer and calmer levels of concentrated energy than were
experienced before. If it does reach such a level of concentration, one
should merely note the fact and keep observing until the time when the
heart withdraws again. Once it has withdrawn one will be able to develop
knowledge and understanding as different problems arise. Here is where
one should investigate and examine the different matters and issues
which affect the heart in order to understand and penetrate them. Once
these problems are finished with, the heart will gradually move inwards
towards the deeper level of concentration again. The heart will stay
there and mature, freed from any other work or external impingement.
There will just be the one-pointed knowing and this will prepare and
strengthen one’s mindfulness until the time is reached to re-emerge.</p>

<p>These conditions of entering and leaving will appear in one’s heart
during the practice, but this is something that is difficult to talk
about. It is not harmful or damaging to one’s practice. After a period
the heart will withdraw and the inner dialogue will start in that place,
taking the form of <em>saṅkhārā</em> or mental formations conditioning the
heart. If one doesn’t know that this activity is <em>saṅkhārā</em>, one might
think that it is paññā, or that paññā is arising. One must see that this
activity is fashioning and conditioning the heart and the most important
thing about it is that it is impermanent. One must continually keep
control and not allow the heart to start following and believing in all
the different creations and stories that it cooks up. All that is just
<em>saṅkhārā</em>, it doesn’t become paññā.</p>

<p>The way paññā develops is when one listens and knows the heart, as the
process of creating and conditioning takes it in different directions;
and then reflects on the instability and uncertainty of this. The
realization of the impermanence of the creations will provide the cause
by which one can let go of things at that point. Once the heart has let
go of things and put them down at that point, it will gradually become
more and more calm and steady. One must keep entering and leaving
samādhi like this for paññā to arise at that point. There one will gain
knowledge and understanding.</p>

<p>As one continues to practise, many different kinds of problems and
difficulties will tend to arise in the heart; but whatever problems the
world, or even the universe might bring up, one will be able to deal
with them all. One’s wisdom will follow them up and find answers for
every question and doubt. Wherever one meditates, whatever thoughts come
up, whatever happens, everything will be providing the cause for paññā
to arise. This is a process that will take place by itself, free from
external influence. Paññā will arise like this, but when it does, one
should be careful not to become deluded and see it as <em>sankhārā</em>.
Whenever one reflects on things and sees them as impermanent and
uncertain, one shouldn’t cling or attach to them in any way. If one
keeps developing this state, when paññā is present in the heart, it will
take the place of one’s normal way of thinking and reacting and the
heart will become fuller and brighter in the centre of everything. As
this happens, one knows and understands all things as they really are;
and one’s heart will be able to progress with meditation in the correct
way without being deluded. That is how it should be.</p>
