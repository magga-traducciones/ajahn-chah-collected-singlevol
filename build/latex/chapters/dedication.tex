This single volume presentation of\\ \textit{The Collected Teachings of Ajahn Chah}\\ is offered as an expression of our deepest gratitude to\\ our teacher, Venerable Ajahn Chah, and to those who have built\\ and maintained his branch monasteries around the world. 

His Sa\.ngha, through the example of their commitment to integrity,\\ contemplation and wisdom, have transformed the lives of millions.\\ The Forest Sa\.ngha communities inspired by Ajahn Chah provide an\\ opportunity for all to practise Dhamma and experience for themselves\\ the wisdom which leads to a life lived in peace and harmony.

The compilers of this volume also wish to acknowledge the support\\ of the many people involved in the preparation of this book --\\ especially to the Kata\~n\~nut\=a group of Malaysia, Singapore and\\ Australia, for bringing it into production.
