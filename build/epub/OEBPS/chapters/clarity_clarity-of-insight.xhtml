<p><span class="dropcaps-first">M</span><span class="dropcaps-words">editate reciting</span> 
<em>‘Buddho, Buddho’</em> until it penetrates deep into the heart of your
consciousness (<em>citta</em>). The word <em>Buddho</em> represents the awareness and
wisdom of the Buddha. In practice, you must depend on this word more
than anything else. The awareness it brings will lead you to understand
the truth about your own mind. It’s a true refuge, which means that
there is both mindfulness and insight present.</p>

<p>Wild animals can have awareness of a sort. They have mindfulness as they
stalk their prey and prepare to attack. Even the predator needs firm
mindfulness to keep hold of the captured prey however defiantly it
struggles to escape death. That is one kind of mindfulness. For this
reason you must be able to distinguish between different kinds of
mindfulness. The Buddha taught to meditate reciting <em>Buddho</em> as a way to
apply the mind. When you consciously apply the mind to an object, it
wakes up. The awareness wakes it up. Once this knowing has arisen
through meditation, you can see the mind clearly. As long as the mind
remains without the awareness of <em>Buddho</em>, even if there is ordinary
worldly mindfulness present, the mind is unawakened and without insight.
It will not lead you to what is truly beneficial.</p>

<p>Sati or mindfulness depends on the presence of <em>Buddho</em> – the knowing.
It must be a clear knowing, which leads to the mind becoming brighter
and more radiant. The illuminating effect that this clear knowing has on
the mind is similar to the brightening of a light in a darkened room. As
long as the room is pitch black, any objects placed inside remain
difficult to distinguish or else completely obscured from view because
of the lack of light. But as you begin intensifying the brightness of
the light inside, it will penetrate throughout the whole room, enabling
you to see more clearly from moment to moment, thus allowing you to know
more and more the details of any object inside there.</p>

<p>You could also compare training the mind with teaching a child. It would
be impossible to force children who still hadn’t learnt to speak, to
accumulate knowledge at an unnaturally fast rate that is beyond their
capability. You can’t get too tough with them or try teaching them more
language than they can take in at any one time, because the children
would simply be unable to hold their attention long enough on what you
were saying.</p>

<p>Your mind is similar. Sometimes it’s appropriate to give yourself some
praise and encouragement; sometimes it’s more appropriate to be
critical. It’s like with children: if you scold them too often and are
too intense in the way you deal with this, they won’t progress in the
right way, even though they might be determined to do well. If you force
them too much, the child will be adversely affected, because they still
lack knowledge and experience and as a result will naturally lose track
of the right way to go. If you do that with your own mind, it isn’t
<em>sammā paṭipadā</em> or the way of practice that leads to enlightenment.
<em>Paṭipadā</em> or practice refers to the training and guidance of body,
speech and mind. Here I am specifically referring to the training of the
mind.</p>

<p>The Buddha taught that training the mind involves knowing how to teach
yourself and go against the grain of your desires. You have to use
different skilful means to teach your mind because it constantly gets
caught into moods of depression and elation. This is the nature of the
unenlightened mind – it’s just like a child. The parents of a child who
hasn’t learnt to speak are in a position to teach it because they know
how to speak and their knowledge of the language is greater. The parents
are constantly in a position to see where their child is lacking in its
understanding, because they know more. Training the mind is like this.
When you have the awareness of <em>Buddho</em>, the mind is wiser and has a
more refined level of knowing than normal. This awareness allows you to
see the conditions of the mind and to see the mind itself; you can see
the state of mind in the midst of all phenomena. This being so, you are
naturally able to employ skilful techniques for training the mind.
Whether you are caught into doubt or any other of the defilements, you
see it as a mental phenomenon that arises in the mind and must be
investigated and dealt with in the mind.</p>

<p>That awareness which we call <em>Buddho</em> is like the parents of the child.
The parents are the children’s teachers in charge of its training, so
it’s quite natural that whenever they allow it to wander freely,
simultaneously they must keep one eye on it, aware of what it’s doing
and where it’s running or crawling to.</p>

<p>Sometimes you can be too clever and have too many good ideas. In the
case of teaching children, you might think so much about what is best
for them, that you could reach the point where the more methods you
think up for teaching them, the further away they move from the goals
you want them to achieve. The more you try and teach them, the more
distant they become, until they actually start to go astray and fail to
develop in the proper way.</p>

<p>In training the mind, it is crucial to overcome sceptical doubt. Doubt
and uncertainty are powerful obstacles that must be dealt with.
Investigation of the three fetters of personality view
(<em>sakkāya-diṭṭhi</em>), blind attachment to rules and practices
(<em>sīlabbata-parāmāsa</em>) and sceptical doubt (<em>vicikicchā</em>) is the way out
of attachment practised by the Noble Ones (<em>ariyapuggalā</em>). But at first
you just understand these defilements from the books – you still lack
insight into how things truly are. Investigating personality view is the
way to go beyond the delusion that identifies the body as a self. This
includes attachment to your own body as a self or attaching to other
people’s bodies as solid selves. <em>Sakkāya-diṭṭhi</em> or personality view
refers to this thing you call yourself. It means attachment to the view
that the body is a self. You must investigate this view until you gain a
new understanding and can see the truth that attachment to the body is
defilement and it obstructs the minds of all human beings from gaining
insight into the Dhamma.</p>

<p>For this reason, before anything else the preceptor will instruct each
new candidate for bhikkhu ordination to investigate the five meditation
objects: hair of the head (<em>kesā</em>), hair of the body (<em>lomā</em>), nails
(<em>nakhā</em>), teeth (<em>dantā</em>) and skin (<em>taco</em>). It is through
contemplation and investigation that you develop insight into
personality view. These objects form the most immediate basis for the
attachment that creates the delusion of personality view. Contemplating
them leads to the direct examination of personality view and provides
the means by which each generation of men and women who take up the
instructions of the preceptor upon entering the community can actually
transcend personality view. But in the beginning you remain deluded,
without insight and hence are unable to penetrate personality view and
see the truth of the way things are. You fail to see the truth because
you still have a firm and unyielding attachment. It’s this attachment
that sustains the delusion.</p>

<p>The Buddha taught to transcend delusion. The way to transcend it is
through clearly seeing the body for what it is. With penetrating insight
you must see that the true nature of both your own body and other
people’s is essentially the same. There is no fundamental difference
between people’s bodies. The body is just the body; it’s not a being, a
self, yours or theirs. This clear insight into the true nature of the
body is called <em>kāyānupassanā</em>. A body exists; you label it and give it
a name. Then you attach and cling to it with the view that it is your
body or his or her body. You attach to the view that the body is
permanent and that it is something clean and pleasant. This attachment
goes deep into the mind. This is the way that the mind clings to the
body.</p>

<p>Personality view means that you are still caught in doubt and
uncertainty about the body. Your insight hasn’t fully penetrated the
delusion that sees the body as a self. As long as the delusion remains,
you call the body a self or <em>attā</em> and interpret your entire experience
from the viewpoint that there is a solid, enduring entity which you call
the self. You are so completely attached to the conventional way of
viewing the body as a self, that there is no apparent way of seeing
beyond it. But clear understanding according to the truth of the way
things are means you see the body as just that much: the body is just
the body. With insight, you see the body as just that much and this
wisdom counteracts the delusion of the sense of self. This insight that
sees the body as just that much, leads to the destruction of attachment
(<em>upādāna</em>) through the gradual uprooting and letting go of delusion.</p>

<p>Practise contemplating the body as being just that much, until it is
quite natural to think to yourself: ‘Oh, the body is merely the body.
It’s just that much.’ Once this way of reflection is established, as
soon as you say to yourself that it’s just that much, the mind lets go.
There is letting go of attachment to the body. There is the insight that
sees the body as merely the body. By sustaining this sense of detachment
through continuous seeing of the body as merely the body, all doubt and
uncertainty are gradually uprooted. As you investigate the body, the
more clearly you see it as just the body rather than a person, a being,
a me or a them, the more powerful the effect on the mind, resulting in
the simultaneous removal of doubt and uncertainty. Blind attachment to
rules and practices (<em>sīlabbata-parāmāsa</em>), which manifests in the mind
as blindly fumbling and feeling around through lack of clarity as to the
real purpose of practice, is abandoned simultaneously because it arises
in conjunction with personality view.</p>

<p>You could say that the three fetters of doubt, blind attachment to rites
and practices and personality view are inseparable and even similes for
each other. Once you have seen this relationship clearly, when one of
the three fetters, such as doubt for instance, arises and you are able
to let it go through the cultivation of insight, the other two fetters
are automatically abandoned at the same time. They are extinguished
together. Simultaneously, you let go of personality view and the blind
attachment that is the cause of fumbling and fuzziness of intention over
different practices. You see them each as one part of your overall
attachment to the sense of self, which is to be abandoned. You must
repeatedly investigate the body and break it down into its component
parts. As you see each part as it truly is, the perception of the body
being a solid entity or self is gradually eroded away. You have to keep
putting continuous effort into this investigation of the truth and can’t
let up.</p>

<p>A further aspect of mental development that leads to clearer and deeper
insight is meditating on an object to calm the mind down. The calm mind
is the mind that is firm and stable in samādhi. This can be <em>khaṇika
samādhi</em> (momentary concentration), <em>upacāra-samādhi</em> (neighbourhood
concentration) or <em>appaṇā samādhi</em> (absorption). The level of
concentration is determined by the refinement of consciousness from
moment to moment as you train the mind to maintain awareness on a
meditation object.</p>

<p>In <em>khaṇika samādhi</em> (momentary concentration) the mind unifies for just
a short space of time. It calms down in samādhi, but having gathered
together momentarily, immediately withdraws from that peaceful state. As
concentration becomes more refined in the course of meditation, many
similar characteristics of the tranquil mind are experienced at each
level, so each one is described as a level of samādhi, whether it is
<em>khaṇika</em>, <em>upacāra</em> or <em>appaṇā</em>. At each level the mind is calm, but
the depth of the samādhi varies and the nature of the peaceful mental
state experienced differs. On one level the mind is still subject to
movement and can wander, but moves around within the confines of the
concentrated state. It doesn’t get caught in activity that leads to
agitation and distraction. Your awareness might follow a wholesome
mental object for a while, before returning to settle down at a point of
stillness where it remains for a period.</p>

<p>You could compare the experience of <em>khaṇika samādhi</em> with a physical
activity like taking a walk somewhere: you might walk for a period
before stopping for a rest, and having rested start walking again until
it’s time to stop for another rest. Even though you interrupt the
journey periodically to stop walking and take rests, each time remaining
completely still, it is only ever a temporary stillness of the body.
After a short space of time you have to start moving again to continue
the journey. This is what happens within the mind as it experiences such
a level of concentration.</p>

<p>If you practise meditation focusing on an object to calm the mind and
reach a level of calm where the mind is firm in samādhi, but there is
still some mental movement occurring, that is known as
<em>upacāra-samādhi</em>. In <em>upacāra-samādhi</em> the mind can still move around.
This movement takes place within certain limits, the mind doesn’t move
beyond them. The boundaries within which the mind can move are
determined by the firmness and stability of concentration. The
experience is as if you alternate between a state of calm and a certain
amount of mental activity. The mind is calm some of the time and active
for the rest. Within that activity there is still a certain level of
calm and concentration that persists, but the mind is not completely
still or immovable. It is still thinking a little and wandering about.
It’s like you are wandering around inside your own home. You wander
around within the limits of your concentration, without losing awareness
and moving outdoors away from the meditation object. The movement of the
mind stays within the bounds of wholesome (<em>kusala</em>) mental states. It
doesn’t get caught into any mental proliferation based on unwholesome
(<em>akusala</em>) mental states. Any thinking remains wholesome. Once the mind
is calm, it necessarily experiences wholesome mental states from moment
to moment. During the time it is concentrated the mind only experiences
wholesome mental states and periodically settles down to become
completely still and one-pointed on its object.</p>

<p>So the mind still experiences some movement, circling around its object.
It can still wander. It might wander around within the confines set by
the level of concentration, but no real harm arises from this movement
because the mind is calm in samādhi. This is how the development of the
mind proceeds in the course of practice.</p>

<p>In <em>appaṇā samādhi</em> the mind calms down and is stilled to a level where
it is at its most subtle and skilful. Even if you experience sense
impingement from the outside, such as sounds and physical sensations, it
remains external and is unable to disturb the mind. You might hear a
sound, but it won’t distract your concentration. There is the hearing of
the sound, but the experience is as if you don’t hear anything. There is
awareness of the impingement but it’s as if you are not aware. This is
because you let go. The mind lets go automatically. Concentration is so
deep and firm that you let go of attachment to sense impingement quite
naturally. The mind can absorb into this state for long periods. Having
stayed inside for an appropriate amount of time, it then withdraws.
Sometimes, as you withdraw from such a deep level of concentration, a
mental image of some aspect of your own body can appear. It might be a
mental image displaying an aspect of the unattractive nature of your
body that arises into consciousness. As the mind withdraws from the
refined state, the image of the body appears to emerge and expand from
within the mind. Any aspect of the body could come up as a mental image
and fill up the mind’s eye at that point.</p>

<p>Images that come up in this way are extremely clear and unmistakable.
You have to have genuinely experienced very deep tranquillity for them
to arise. You see them absolutely clearly, even though your eyes are
closed. If you open your eyes you can’t see them, but with eyes shut and
the mind absorbed in samādhi, you can see such images as clearly as if
viewing the object with eyes wide open. You can even experience a whole
train of consciousness, where from moment to moment the mind’s awareness
is fixed on images expressing the unattractive nature of the body. The
appearance of such images in a calm mind can become the basis for
insight into the impermanent nature of the body, as well as into its
unattractive, unclean and unpleasant nature, or into the complete lack
of any real self or essence within it.</p>

<p>When these kinds of special knowledge arise they provide the basis for
skilful investigation and the development of insight. You bring this
kind of insight right inside your heart. As you do this more and more,
it becomes the cause for insight knowledge to arise by itself.
Sometimes, when you turn your attention to reflecting on the subject of
<em>asubha,</em> images of different unattractive aspects of the body can
manifest in the mind automatically. These images are clearer than any
you could try to summon up with your imagination and lead to insight of
a far more penetrating nature than that gained through the ordinary kind
of discursive thinking. This kind of clear insight has such a striking
impact that the activity of the mind is brought to a stop followed by
the experience of a deep sense of dispassion. The reason it is so clear
and piercing is that it originates from a completely peaceful mind.
Investigating from within a state of calm, leads you to clearer and
clearer insight, the mind becoming more peaceful as it is increasingly
absorbed in the contemplation. The clearer and more conclusive the
insight, the deeper inside the mind penetrates with its investigation,
constantly supported by the calm of samādhi. This is what the practice
of <em>kammaṭṭhāna:</em> involves. Continuous investigation in this way helps
you to repeatedly let go of and ultimately destroy attachment to
personality view. It brings an end to all remaining doubt and
uncertainty about this heap of flesh we call the body and the letting go
of blind attachment to rules and practices.</p>

<p>Even in the event of serious illness, tropical fevers or different
health problems that normally have a strong physical impact and shake
the body up, your samādhi and insight remains firm and imperturbable.
Your understanding and insight allows you to make a clear distinction
between mind and body – the mind is one phenomenon, the body another.
Once you see body and mind as completely and indisputably separate from
each other, it means that the practice of insight has brought you to the
point where your mind sees for certain the true nature of the body.</p>

<p>Seeing the way the body truly is, clearly and beyond doubt from within
the calm of samādhi, leads to the mind experiencing a strong sense of
weariness and turning away (<em>nibbidā</em>). This turning away comes from the
sense of disenchantment and dispassion that arises as the natural result
of seeing the way things are. It’s not a turning away that comes from
ordinary worldly moods such as fear, revulsion or other unwholesome
qualities like envy or aversion. It’s not coming from the same root of
attachment as those defiled mental states. This is turning away that has
a spiritual quality to it and has a different effect on the mind from
that of the normal moods of boredom and weariness experienced by
ordinary unenlightened human beings (<em>puthujjana</em>). Usually when
ordinary unenlightened human beings are weary and fed up, they get
caught into moods of aversion, rejection and seeking to avoid. The
experience of insight is not the same.</p>

<p>The sense of world-weariness that grows with insight, however, leads to
detachment, turning away and aloofness that comes naturally from
investigating and seeing the truth of the way things are. It is free
from attachment to a sense of self that attempts to control and force
things to go according to its desires. Rather, you let go with an
acceptance of the way things are. The clarity of insight is so strong
that you no longer experience any sense of a self that has to struggle
against the flow of its desires or endure through attachment. The three
fetters of personality view, doubt and blind attachment to rules and
practices that are normally present underlying the way you view the
world can’t delude you or cause you to make any serious mistakes in
practice. This is the very beginning of the path, the first clear
insight into ultimate truth, and paves the way for further insight. You
could describe it as penetrating the Four Noble Truths.</p>

<p>The Four Noble Truths are things to be realized through insight. Every
monk and nun, who has ever realized them, has experienced such insight
into the truth of the way things are. You know suffering, you know the
cause of suffering, you know the cessation of suffering and you know the
path leading to the cessation of suffering. Understanding of each Noble
Truth emerges at the same place within the mind. They come together and
harmonize as the factors of the Noble Eightfold Path; and the Buddha
taught that they are to be realized within the mind. As the path factors
converge in the centre of the mind, they cut through any doubts and
uncertainty you still have concerning the way of practice.</p>

<p>During the course of practising, it is normal that you experience the
different conditions of the mind. You constantly experience desires to
do this and that or to go different places, as well as the different
moods of mental pain, frustration or else indulgence in pleasure seeking
– all of which are the fruits of past kamma. All this resultant kamma
swells up inside the mind and puffs it out. However, it is the product
of past actions. Knowing that it is all stuff coming up from the past,
you don’t allow yourself to make anything new or extra out of it. You
observe and reflect on the arising and cessation of conditions. That
which has not yet arisen is still unarisen. This word ‘arise’ refers to
<em>upādāna</em> or the mind’s firm attachment and clinging. Over time your
mind has been exposed to and conditioned by craving and defilement, and
the mental conditions and characteristics you experience reflect that.
Having developed insight, your mind no longer follows those old habit
patterns that were fashioned by defilement. A separation occurs between
the mind and those defiled ways of thinking and reacting. The mind
separates from the defilements.</p>

<p>You can compare this with the effect of putting oil and water together
in a bottle. Each liquid has a very different density so it doesn’t
matter whether you keep them in the same bottle or in separate ones,
because the difference in their density prevents the liquids from mixing
together or permeating into each other. The oil doesn’t mix with the
water and vice versa. They remain in separate parts of the bottle. You
can compare the bottle with the world, and these two different liquids
in the bottle, that have been put there are forced to stay within its
confines are similar to you living in the world with insight that
separates your mind from the defilements. You can say that you are
living in the world and following the conventions of the world, but
without attaching to it. When you have to go somewhere you say you are
going, when you are coming you say you are coming or whatever you are
doing you use the conventions and language of the world, but it’s like
the two liquids in the bottle – they are in the same bottle but don’t
mix together. You live in the world, but at the same time you remain
separate from it. The Buddha knew the truth for himself. He was the
<em>lokavidū</em> – the knower of the world.</p>

<p>What are the sense bases (<em>āyatana</em>)? They consist of the eyes, ears,
nose, tongue, body and mind. The ears hear sound; the nose performs the
function of smelling different smells, whether fragrant or pungent; the
tongue has the function of tasting tastes whether sweet, sour, rich or
salty; the body senses heat and cold, softness and hardness; the mind
receives mind objects which arise in the same way as they always have.
The sense bases function just as they did before. You experience sensory
impingement in just the same way as you always have. It’s not true that
after the experience of insight your nose no longer experiences any
smells, or your tongue that formerly was able to taste can no longer
taste anything, or the body is unable to feel anything anymore.</p>

<p>Your ability to experience the world through the senses remains intact,
just the same as before you started practising insight, but the mind’s
reaction to sense impingement is to see it as ‘just that much’. The mind
doesn’t attach to fixed perceptions or make anything out of the
experience of sense objects. It lets go. The mind knows that it is
letting go. As you gain insight into the true nature of the Dhamma, it
naturally results in letting go. There is awareness followed by
abandoning of attachment. There is understanding and then letting go.
With insight you set things down. Insight knowledge doesn’t lead to
clinging or attachment; it doesn’t increase your suffering. That’s not
what happens. True insight into the Dhamma results in letting go. You
know that attachment is the cause of suffering, so you abandon it. Once
you have insight the mind lets go. It puts down what it was formerly
holding on to.</p>

<p>Another way to describe this is to say that you are no longer fumbling
or groping around in your practice. You are no longer blindly groping
and attaching to forms, sounds, smells, tastes, bodily sensations or
mind objects. The experience of sense objects through the eyes, ears,
nose, tongue, body and mind no longer stimulates the same old habitual
movements of mind where it is seeking to get involved with such sense
objects or adding on to the experience through further proliferation.
The mind doesn’t create things around sense contact. Once contact has
occurred you automatically let go. The mind discards the experience.
This means that if you are attracted to something, you experience the
attraction in the mind but you don’t attach or hold on fast to it. If
you have a reaction of aversion, there is simply the experience of
aversion arising in the mind and nothing more: there isn’t any sense of
self arising that attaches and gives meaning and importance to the
aversion. In other words the mind knows how to let go; it knows how to
set things aside. Why is it able to let go and put things down? Because
the presence of insight means you can see the harmful results that come
from attaching to all those mental states.</p>

<p>When you see forms the mind remains undisturbed; when you hear sounds it
remains undisturbed. The mind doesn’t take a position for or against any
sense objects experienced. This is the same for all sense contact,
whether it is through the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body or mind.
Whatever thoughts arise in the mind can’t disturb you. You are able to
let go. You may perceive something as desirable, but you don’t attach to
that perception or give it any special importance – it simply becomes a
condition of mind to be observed without attachment. This is what the
Buddha described as experiencing sense objects as ‘just that much’. The
sense bases are still functioning and experiencing sense objects, but
without the process of attachment stimulating movements to and fro in
the mind. There is no conditioning of the mind occurring in the sense of
a self moving from this place to that place or from that place moving to
this place. Sense contact occurs between the six sense bases as normal,
but the mind doesn’t <em>take sides</em> by getting caught in conditions of
attraction or aversion. You understand how to let go. There is awareness
of sense contact followed by letting go. You let go with awareness and
sustain the awareness after you have let go. This is how the process of
insight works. Every angle and every aspect of the mind and its
experience naturally becomes part of the practice.</p>

<p>This is the way the mind is affected as you train it. It becomes very
obvious that the mind has changed and is not the same as usual. It no
longer behaves in the way you are accustomed to. You are no longer
creating a self out of your experience. For example, when you experience
the death of your mother, father or anyone else who is close to you, if
your mind remains firm in the practice of calm and insight and is able
to reflect skilfully on what has happened, you won’t create suffering
for yourself out of the event. Rather than panicking or feeling shocked
at the news of that person’s death, there is just a sense of sadness and
dispassion coming from wise reflection. You are aware of the experience
and then let go. There is the knowing and then you lay it aside. You let
go without generating any further suffering for yourself. This is
because you know clearly what causes suffering to arise. When you do
encounter suffering you are aware of that suffering. As soon as you
start to experience suffering you automatically ask yourself the
question: where does it come from? Suffering has its cause and that is
the attachment and clinging still left in the mind. So you have to let
go of the attachment. All suffering comes from a cause. Having created
the cause, you abandon it. Abandon it with wisdom. You let go of it
through insight, which means wisdom. You can’t let go through delusion.
This is the way it is.</p>

<p>The investigation and development of insight into the Dhamma gives rise
to this profound peace of mind. When you have gained such clear and
penetrating insight, it is sustained at all times whether you are
sitting meditation with your eyes closed, or even if you are doing
something with your eyes open. Whatever situation you find yourself in,
be it in formal meditation or not, the clarity of insight remains. When
you have unwavering mindfulness of the mind within the mind, you don’t
forget yourself. Whether standing, walking, sitting or lying down, the
awareness within makes it impossible to lose mindfulness. It’s a state
of awareness that prevents you forgetting yourself. Mindfulness has
become so strong that it is self-sustaining to the point where it
becomes natural for the mind to be that way. These are the results of
training and cultivating the mind and it is here where you go beyond
doubt. You have no doubts about the future; you have no doubts about the
past and accordingly have no need to doubt about the present either. You
still have awareness that there is such a thing as past, present and
future. You are aware of the existence of time. There is the reality of
the past, present and future, but you are no longer concerned or worried
about it.</p>

<p>Why are you no longer concerned? All those things that took place in the
past have already happened. The past has already passed by. All that is
arising in the present is the result of causes that lay in the past. An
obvious example of this is to say that if you don’t feel hungry now,
it’s because you have already eaten at some time in the past. The lack
of hunger in the present is the result of actions performed in the past.
If you know your experience in the present, you can know the past.
Eating a meal was the cause from the past that resulted in you feeling
at ease or energetic in the present, and this provides the cause for you
to be active and work in the future. So the present is providing causes
that will bring results in the future. The past, present and future can
thus be seen as one and the same. The Buddha called it <em>eko dhammo -</em>
the unity of the Dhamma. It isn’t many different things; there is just
this much. When you see the present, you see the future. By
understanding the present you understand the past. Past, present and
future make up a chain of continuous cause and effect and hence are
constantly flowing on from one to the other. There are causes from the
past that produce results in the present and these are already producing
causes for the future. This process of cause and result applies to
practice in the same way. You experience the fruits of having trained
the mind in samādhi and insight, and these necessarily make the mind
wiser and more skilful.</p>

<p>The mind completely transcends doubt. You are no longer uncertain or
speculating about anything. The lack of doubt means you no longer fumble
around or have to feel your way through the practice. As a result you
live and act in accordance with nature. You live in the world in the
most natural way. That means living in the world peacefully. You are
able to find peace even in the midst of that which is unpeaceful. You
are fully able to live in the world. You are able to live in the world
without creating any problems. The Buddha lived in the world and was
able to find true peace of mind within the world. As practitioners of
the Dhamma, you must learn to do the same. Don’t get lost in and
attached to perceptions about things being this way or that way. Don’t
attach or give undue importance to any perceptions that are still
deluded. Whenever the mind becomes stirred up, investigate and
contemplate the cause. When you aren’t making any suffering for yourself
out of things, you are at ease. When there are no issues causing mental
agitation, you remain equanimous. That is, you continue to practise
normally with a mental equanimity maintained by the presence of
mindfulness and an all-round awareness. You keep a sense of self-control
and equilibrium. If any matter arises and prevails upon the mind, you
immediately take hold of it for thorough investigation and
contemplation. If there is clear insight at that moment, you penetrate
the matter with wisdom and prevent it creating any suffering in the
mind. If there is not yet clear insight, you let the matter go
temporarily through the practice of samatha meditation and don’t allow
the mind to attach. At some point in the future, your insight will
certainly be strong enough to penetrate it, because sooner or later you
will develop insight powerful enough to comprehend everything that still
causes attachment and suffering.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the mind has to make a great effort to struggle with and
overcome the reactions to stimulations by every kind of sense object and
mental state that you experience. It must work hard with every single
object that contacts it. All the six internal sense bases and their
external objects converge on the mind. By focusing awareness on the mind
alone, you gain understanding and insight into the eyes, ears, nose,
tongue, body, mind and all their objects. The mind is there already, so
the important thing is to investigate right at the centre of the mind.
The further you go investigating the mind itself, the clearer and more
profound the insight that emerges. This is something I emphasize when
teaching, because understanding this point is crucial to the practice.
Normally, when you experience sense contact and receive impingement from
different objects, the mind is just waiting to react with attraction or
aversion. That is what happens with the unenlightened mind. It’s ready
to get caught into good moods because of one kind of stimulation or bad
moods because of another kind.</p>

<p>Here you examine the mind with firm and unwavering attention. As you
experience different objects through the senses, you don’t let it feed
mental proliferation. You don’t get caught in a lot of defiled thinking
– you are already practising vipassanā and depending on insight wisdom
to investigate all sense objects. The mode of vipassanā meditation is
what develops wisdom. Training with the different objects of samatha
meditation – whether it is the recitation of a word such as <em>Buddho</em>,
<em>Dhammo</em>, <em>Saṅgho</em> or the practice of mindfulness with the breathing –
results in the mind experiencing the calm and firmness of samādhi. In
samatha meditation you focus awareness on a single object and let go of
all others temporarily.</p>

<p>Vipassanā meditation is similar because you use the reflection ‘don’t
believe it’ as you make contact with sense objects. Practising
vipassanā, you don’t let any sense object delude you. You are aware of
each object as soon as it converges in on the mind, whether it is
experienced with the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body or mind and you use
this reflection ‘don’t believe it’ almost like a verbal meditation
object to be repeated over and over again. Every object immediately
becomes a source of insight. You use the mind that is firm in samādhi to
investigate each object’s impermanent nature. At each moment of sense
contact you bring up the reflection: ‘It’s not certain’ or ‘This is
impermanent.’ If you are caught in delusion and believe in the object
experienced you suffer, because all these dhammas (phenomena) are
non-self (<em>anattā</em>). If you attach to anything that is non-self and
misperceive it as self, it automatically becomes a cause for pain and
distress. This is because you attach to mistaken perceptions.</p>

<p>Repeatedly examine the truth, over and over again until you understand
clearly that all these sense objects lack any true self. They do not
belong to any real self. Why, then, do you misunderstand and attach to
them as being a self or belonging to a self? This is where you must put
forth effort to keep reflecting on the truth. They aren’t truly you.
They don’t belong to you. Why do you misunderstand them as being a self?
None of these sense objects can be considered as you in any ultimate
sense. So why do they delude you into seeing them as a self? In truth,
there’s no way it could possibly be like that. All sense objects are
impermanent, so why do you see them as permanent? It’s incredible how
they delude you. The body is inherently unattractive, so how can you
possibly attach to the view that it is something attractive? These
ultimate truths – the unattractiveness of the body and the impermanence
and lack of self in all formations – become obvious with investigation
and finally you see that this thing we call the world is actually a
delusion created out of these wrong views.</p>

<p>As you use insight meditation to investigate the three characteristics
and penetrate the true nature of phenomena, it’s not necessary to do
anything special. There’s no need to go to extremes. Don’t make it
difficult for yourself. Focus your awareness directly, as if you are
sitting down receiving guests who are entering into a reception room. In
your reception room there is only one chair, so the different guests
that come into the room to meet you are unable to sit down because you
are already sitting in the only chair available. If a visitor enters the
room, you know who they are straight away. Even if two, three or many
visitors come into the room together, you instantly know who they are
because they have nowhere to sit down. You occupy the only seat
available, so every single visitor who comes in is quite obvious to you
and unable to stay for very long.</p>

<p>You can observe all the visitors at your ease because they don’t have
anywhere to sit down. You fix awareness on investigating the three
characteristics of impermanence, suffering and non-self and hold your
attention on this contemplation not sending it anywhere else. Insight
into the transient, unsatisfactory and selfless nature of all phenomena
steadily grows clearer and more comprehensive. Your understanding grows
more profound. Such clarity of insight leads to a peace that penetrates
deeper into your heart than any you might experience from the practice
of tranquillity (samatha) meditation. It is the clarity and completeness
of this insight into the way things are that has a purifying effect on
the mind. Wisdom arising as a result of deep and crystal clear insight
acts as the agent of purification.</p>

<p>Through repeated examination and contemplation of the truth, over time,
your views change and what you once mistakenly perceived as attractive
gradually loses its appeal as the truth of its unattractive nature
becomes apparent. You investigate phenomena to see if they are really
permanent or of a transient nature. At first you simply recite to
yourself the teaching that all conditions are impermanent, but after
time you actually see the truth clearly from your investigation. The
truth is waiting to be found right at the point of investigation. This
is the seat where you wait to receive visitors. There is nowhere else
you could go to develop insight. You must remain seated on this one spot
– the only chair in the room. As visitors enter your reception room, it
is easy to observe their appearance and the way they behave, because
they are unable to sit down; inevitably you get to know all about them.
In other words you arrive at a clear and distinct understanding of the
impermanent, unsatisfactory and selfless nature of all these phenomena
and this insight has become so indisputable and firm in your mind, that
it puts an end to any remaining uncertainty about the true nature of
things. You know for certain that there is no other possible way of
viewing experience. This is realization of the Dhamma at the most
profound level. Ultimately, your meditation involves sustaining the
knowing, followed by continuous letting go as you experience sense
objects through the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body and mind. It involves
just this much and there is no need to make anything more out of it.</p>

<p>The important thing is to put repeated effort into developing insight
through investigation of the three characteristics. Everything can
become a cause for wisdom to arise, and that is what completely destroys
all forms of defilement and attachment. This is the fruit of vipassanā
meditation. But don’t assume that everything you do is coming from
insight. Sometimes you still do things following your own desires. If
you are still practising following your desires, then you will only put
effort in on the days when you are feeling energetic and inspired, and
you won’t do any meditation on the days when you are feeling lazy.
That’s called practising under the influence of the defilements. It
means you don’t have any real power over your mind and just follow your
desires.</p>

<p>When your mind is in line with the Dhamma, there is no one who is
diligent and there is no one who is lazy. It’s a matter of how the mind
is conditioned. The practice of insight keeps flowing automatically
without laziness or diligence. It’s a state that is self-sustaining,
fuelled by its own energy. Once the mind has these characteristics, it
means you no longer have to be the doer in the practice. You could say
that it’s as if you have finished all the work you have been doing and
the only thing left is for you to leave things to themselves and watch
over the mind. You don’t have to be someone who is doing something
anymore. There is still mental activity occurring – you experience
pleasant and unpleasant sense contact according to your kammic
accumulations – but you see it as ‘just that much’ and are letting go of
attachment to the sense of self the whole time.</p>

<p>At this point, you aren’t creating a self and so you aren’t creating any
suffering. All the sense objects and moods you experience ultimately
have exactly the same value in the mind. Whatever mental or physical
phenomena you examine appear the same as everything else, bearing the
same inherent qualities. All phenomena become one and the same. Your
wisdom has to develop that far for all uncertainty to come to an end in
the mind.</p>

<p>When you first start meditating, it seems like all you know how to do is
to doubt and speculate about things. The mind is always wavering and
vacillating. You spend the whole time caught in agitated thinking and
proliferating about things. You have doubts about every last thing. Why?
It stems from impatience. You want to know all the answers and fast. You
want to have insight quickly, without having to do anything. You want to
know the truth of the way things are, but that wanting is so strong in
the mind that it is more powerful than the insight you desire. For that
reason the practice has to develop in stages. You must go one step at a
time. In the first place you need to put forth persistent effort. You
also need the continuous support of your past good actions and
development of the ten spiritual perfections (<em>pāramī</em>).</p>

<p>Keep summoning up effort in training the mind. Don’t get caught into
desiring quick results; that just leads you to disappointment and
frustration when the insights are slow to come. Thinking like that won’t
help you. Is it correct to expect suddenly to experience some kind of
permanent state where you are experiencing no pleasure or pain at all?
It doesn’t matter what the mind throws up at you. At that time when you
do get overwhelmed by pleasure and pain stimulated by contact between
the mind and different sense objects, you don’t have any idea what level
your practice has reached. But within a short space of time such moods
lose power over the mind. Actually, such impingement can be of benefit,
because it reminds you to examine your own experience. You get to know
what reactions all the sense objects, thoughts and perceptions you
experience bring up in the mind. You know, both in the cases when they
lead the mind towards agitation and suffering, and when they hardly stir
the mind at all. Some meditators just want to have insight into the way
the mind is affected by pleasant objects; they only want to investigate
the good moods. But that way they never gain true insight. They don’t
become very smart. Really, you must also examine what happens when you
experience unpleasant sense impingement. You have to know what that does
to the mind. In the end, that’s the way you have to train yourself.</p>

<p>It is also important to understand that when it comes to the practice
itself, you don’t need to seek out the past experiences and accumulated
memories available from external sources, because it’s your own
experience that counts. The only way to really put an end to your doubts
and speculation is through practising until you reach the point where
you see the results clearly for yourself. This is the most important
thing of all. Learning from different teachers is an essential
preliminary to practice. It is a valuable support as you move from
hearing the teachings to learning from your own experience. You have to
contemplate the teachings you receive in light of your own practice
until you gain your own understanding. If you already possess some
spiritual qualities and virtue accumulated from the past, practice is
more straightforward. When other people give you advice, generally it
can save you time, by helping you to avoid mistakes and to go directly
to the heart of practice. If you try practising alone without any
guidance from others, the path you follow will be a slower one with more
detours. If you try to discover the correct way to practise all by
yourself, you tend to waste time and end up going the long way round.
That’s the truth of it. In the end, the practice of Dhamma itself is the
surest way to make all the doubting and wavering wither away and vanish.
As you keep enduring and training yourself to go against the grain of
your defilements the doubts will just shrivel up and die. If you think
about it, you have already gained much from your efforts in the
practice. You have made progress, but it’s still not enough to make you
feel completely satisfied. If you look carefully and reflect on your
life, you can see just how much of the world you have experienced
through your mind from the time you were born, through your youth until
the present. In the past you weren’t training yourself in virtue,
concentration and wisdom, and it’s easy to see just how far the
defilements took you. When you look back on all that you have
experienced through the senses it becomes obvious that you have been
experiencing the truth about the way things are on countless occasions.
As you contemplate the things that have happened in your life, it helps
lighten the mind as you see that the defilements don’t cover it over
quite so thickly as before.</p>

<p>From time to time you need to encourage yourself in this way. It takes
away some of the heaviness. However, it’s not wise to only give yourself
praise and encouragement. In training the mind, you have to criticize
yourself every now and then. Sometimes you have to force yourself to do
things you don’t want to do, but you can’t push the mind to its limits
all the time. As you train yourself in meditation it is normal that the
body, which is a conditioned phenomenon, is subject to stress, pain and
all sorts of different problems as conditions affect it. It’s just
normal for the body to be like that. The more you train yourself in
sitting meditation, the more skilled at it you become and naturally you
can sit for longer periods. At first you might only be able to manage
five minutes before you have to get up. But as you practise more, the
length of time you can sit comfortably increases from ten to twenty
minutes to half an hour, until in the end you can sit for a whole hour
without having to get up. Then other people look at you and praise you
for being able to sit so long, but at the same time, you might feel
within yourself, that you still can’t sit for very long at all. This is
the way the desire for results can affect you in the course of
meditation.</p>

<p>Another important aspect of the training is to sustain the practice of
mindfulness evenly in all the four postures of standing, walking,
sitting and lying down. Be careful not to mistakenly think that you are
only really practising when sitting in the formal meditation posture.
Don’t see it as the only posture for cultivating mindfulness. That’s a
mistake. It’s quite possible that calm and insight might not even arise
during the course of formal sitting meditation. It’s only feasible to
sit for so many hours and minutes in one day but you have to train
yourself in mindfulness constantly as you change from posture to
posture, developing a continuous awareness. Whenever you lose awareness,
re-establish it as soon as possible to try and keep as much continuity
as you can. This is the way to make fast progress. Insight comes
quickly. It’s the way to become wise. That means wise in understanding
sense objects and how they affect the mind. You use this wisdom to know
your moods and to train the mind in letting go. This is how you should
understand the way to cultivate the mind. Even as you lie down to sleep,
you have to fix attention on the in- and out-breaths until the moment
you fall asleep and continue on as soon as you wake up. That way there
is only a short period when you are in deep sleep that you are not
practising awareness. You have to throw all your energy into training
yourself.</p>

<p>Once you have developed awareness, the longer you train yourself, the
more wakefulness the mind experiences until you reach a point where you
don’t seem to sleep at all. Only the body sleeps, the mind remains
aware. The mind remains awake and vigilant even as the body sleeps. You
remain with the knowing throughout. As soon as you awake, mindfulness is
right there from the first moment as the mind leaves the sleeping state
and immediately takes hold of a fresh object. You are attentive and
watchful. Sleeping is really a function of the body. It involves resting
the body. The body takes the rest it needs, but there is still the
knowing present, watching over the mind. Awareness is sustained both
throughout the day and night.</p>

<p>So, even though you lie down and go to sleep, it’s as if the mind
doesn’t sleep. But you don’t feel tired out and hungry for more sleep.
You remain alert and attentive. It’s for this reason that you hardly
dream at all when you are practising in earnest. If you do dream, it is
in the form of a <em>supina nimitta</em> – an unusually clear and vivid dream
that holds some special significance. Generally, however, you experience
very few dreams. As you watch over the mind it’s as if there are no
causes left for the mental proliferation that fuels dreams. You remain
in a state where you aren’t caught in delusion. You sustain mindfulness,
with awareness present deep inside the mind. The mind is in a state of
wakefulness, being sharp and responsive. The presence of unbroken
mindfulness makes the mind’s ability to investigate smooth and
effortless and keeps it abreast of whatever is arising from moment to
moment.</p>

<p>You have to cultivate the mind until it’s totally fluent and skilled in
keeping mindfulness and investigating phenomena. Whenever the mind
reaches a state of calm, train it in examining your own body and that of
other people until you have deep enough insight to see the common
characteristics. Pursue the investigation to the point where you see all
bodies as having the same essential nature and having come from the same
material elements. You must keep observing and contemplating. Before you
go to sleep at night, use awareness to sweep over the entire body and
repeat the contemplation when you first wake up in the morning. This way
you won’t have to experience nightmares, talk in your sleep or get
caught up in a lot of dreaming. You sleep and wake up peacefully without
anything bothering you. You sustain the state of knowing both in your
sleep and as you wake up. When you wake up with mindfulness, the mind is
bright, clear and unbothered by sleepiness. As you awaken the mind is
radiant, being free from dullness and moods conditioned by the
defilements.</p>

<p>Here I have been giving details of the development of the mind in the
course of practice. Normally, you wouldn’t think it possible that the
mind could actually be peaceful during the time you are asleep, when you
first wake up or in other situations where you would expect mindfulness
to be weak. For instance, you might be sitting down soaking wet having
just walked through a heavy rainstorm, but because you have cultivated
samādhi and learnt to contemplate, the mind remains untouched by defiled
moods and is still able to experience peace and clarity of insight, just
as I have been describing.</p>

<p>The last teaching the Buddha gave to the community of monks was an
exhortation not to get caught in heedlessness. He said that heedlessness
is the way that leads to death. Please understand this and take it to
heart as fully and sincerely as you can. Train yourself to think with
wisdom. Use wisdom to guide your speech. Whatever you do, use wisdom as
your guide.</p>
