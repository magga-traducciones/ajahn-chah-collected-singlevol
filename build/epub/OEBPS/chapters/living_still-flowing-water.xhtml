<p><span class="dropcaps-first">N</span><span class="dropcaps-words">ow please pay
attention,</span>  not allowing your mind to wander off after
other things. Create the feeling that right now you are sitting on a
mountain or in a forest somewhere, all by yourself. What do you have
sitting here right now? There is body and mind, that’s all, only these
two things. All that is contained within this frame sitting here now is
called ‘body’. The ‘mind’ is that which is aware and is thinking at this
very moment. These two things are also called <em>nāma</em> and <em>rūpa.</em> <em>Nāma</em>
refers to that which has no <em>rūpa</em>, or form. All thoughts and feelings,
or the four mental khandhas of feeling, perception, volition and
consciousness, are <em>nāma</em>, they are all formless. When the eye sees
form, that form is called <em>rūpa</em>, while the awareness is called <em>nāma</em>.
Together they are called <em>nāma</em> and <em>rūpa</em>, or simply mind and body.</p>

<p>Understand that only body and mind are sitting here in this present
moment. But we get these two things confused with each other. If you
want peace you must know the truth of them. The mind in its present
state is still untrained; it’s dirty, not clear. It is not yet the pure
mind. We must train this mind further through the practice of
meditation.</p>

<p>Some people think that meditation means to sit in some special way, but
in actual fact standing, sitting, walking and reclining are all vehicles
for meditation practice. You can practise at all times. Samādhi
literally means ‘the firmly established mind.’ To develop samādhi you
don’t have to go bottling the mind up. Some people try to get peaceful
by sitting quietly and having nothing disturb them at all, but that’s
just like being dead. The practice of samādhi is for developing wisdom
and understanding.</p>

<p>Samādhi is the firm mind, the one-pointed mind. On which point is it
fixed? It’s fixed on the point of balance. That’s its point. But people
practise meditation by trying to silence their minds. They say, ‘I try
to sit in meditation but my mind won’t be still for a minute. One
instant it flies off one place, the next instant it flies off somewhere
else. How can I make it stop and be still?’ You don’t have to make it
stop, that’s not the point. Where there is movement is where
understanding can arise. People complain, ‘It runs off and I pull it
back again; then it goes off again and I pull it back once more.’ So
they just sit there pulling back and forth like this.</p>

<p>They think their minds are running all over the place, but actually it
only seems like the mind is running around. For example, look at this
hall here. ‘Oh, it’s so big!’ you say. Actually it’s not big at all.
Whether or not it seems big depends on your perception of it. In fact
this hall is just the size it is, neither big nor small, but people run
around after their feelings all the time.</p>

<p>In order to meditate to find peace, you must understand what peace is.
If you don’t understand it you won’t be able to find it. For example,
suppose today you brought a very expensive pen with you to the
monastery. Now suppose that, on your way here, you put the pen in your
front pocket, but later you put it in the back pocket. Now when you
search your front pocket, it’s not there! You get a fright. You get a
fright because of your misunderstanding, you don’t see the truth of the
matter. Suffering is the result. Whether standing, walking, coming and
going, you can’t stop worrying about your lost pen. Your wrong
understanding causes you to suffer. Understanding wrongly causes
suffering. ‘Such a shame! I only bought that pen a few days ago and now
it’s lost.’</p>

<p>But then you remember, ‘Oh, of course! When I went to bathe I put the
pen in my back pocket.’ As soon as you remember this you feel better
again, even without seeing your pen. You see that? You’re happy again,
you can stop worrying about your pen. You’re sure about it now. As
you’re walking along you run your hand over your back pocket and there
it is. Your mind was deceiving you all along. The worry comes from your
ignorance. Now, seeing the pen, you are beyond doubt, your worries are
calmed. This sort of peace comes from seeing the cause of the problem,
<em>samudaya,</em> the cause of suffering. As soon as you remember that the pen
is in your back pocket there is <em>nirodha,</em> the cessation of suffering.</p>

<p>So you must contemplate in order to find peace. What people usually
refer to as peace is simply the calming of the mind, not the calming of
the defilements. The defilements are simply being temporarily subdued,
just like grass covered by a rock. In three or four days you take the
rock off the grass and in no long time it grows up again. The grass
hadn’t really died, it was simply being suppressed. It’s the same when
sitting in meditation: the mind is calmed but the defilements are not
really calmed. Therefore, samādhi is not a sure thing. To find real
peace you must develop wisdom. Samādhi is one kind of peace, like the
rock covering the grass. In a few days you take the rock away and the
grass grows up again. This is only a temporary peace. The peace of
wisdom is like putting the rock down and not lifting it up, just leaving
it where it is. The grass can’t possibly grow again. This is real peace,
the calming of the defilements, the sure peace which results from
wisdom.</p>

<p>We speak of wisdom (paññā) and samādhi as separate things, but in
essence they are one and the same. Wisdom is the dynamic function of
samādhi; samādhi is the passive aspect of wisdom. They arise from the
same place but take different directions. They have different functions,
like this mango here. A small green mango eventually grows larger and
larger until it is ripe. It is the same mango, the small one, the larger
one and the ripe one are the same mango, but its condition changes. In
Dhamma practice, one condition is called samādhi, the later condition is
called paññā, but in actuality sīla, samādhi, and paññā are all the same
thing, just like the mango.</p>

<p>In any case, in our practice, no matter what aspect you refer to, you
must always begin from the mind. Do you know what this mind is? What is
the mind like? What is it? Where is it? Nobody knows. All we know is
that we want to go over here or over there, we want this and we want
that, we feel good or we feel bad, but the mind itself seems impossible
to know. What is the mind? The mind doesn’t have form. That which
receives impressions, both good and bad, we call ‘mind’. It’s like the
owner of a house. The owner stays at home while visitors come to see
him. He is the one who receives the visitors. Who receives sense
impressions? What is it that perceives? Who lets go of sense
impressions? That is what we call ‘mind’. But people can’t see it, they
think themselves around in circles. ‘What is the mind, what is the
brain?’ Don’t confuse the issue like this. What is it that receives
impressions? Some impressions it likes and some it doesn’t like. Who is
that? Is there one who likes and dislikes? Sure there is, but you can’t
see it. That is what we call ‘mind’.</p>

<p>In our practice it isn’t necessary to talk of samatha or vipassanā; just
call it the practice of Dhamma, that’s enough. And conduct this practice
from your own mind. What is the mind? The mind is that which receives,
or is aware of, sense impressions. With some sense impressions there is
a reaction of like, with others the reaction is dislike. The receiver of
impressions leads us into happiness and suffering, right and wrong. But
it doesn’t have any form. We assume it to be a self, but it’s really
only <em>nāmadhamma.</em> Does ‘goodness’ have any form? Does evil? Do
happiness and suffering have any form? You can’t find them. Are they
round or are they square, short or long? Can you see them? These things
are <em>nāmadhamma</em>, they can’t be compared to material things, they are
formless, but we know that they do exist.</p>

<p>Therefore, it is said, to begin the practice by calming the mind. Put
awareness into the mind. If the mind is aware it will be at peace. Some
people don’t go for awareness, they just want to have peace, a kind of
blanking out. So they never learn anything. If we don’t have this ‘one
who knows’, what is there to base our practice on?</p>

<p>If there is no long, there is no short, if there is no right, there can
be no wrong. People these days study away, looking for good and evil.
But that which is beyond good and evil they know nothing of. All they
know is the right and the wrong – ‘I’m going to take only what is right.
I don’t want to know about the wrong. Why should I?’ If you try to take
only what is right in a short time it will go wrong again. Right leads
to wrong. People keep searching among the right and wrong, they don’t
try to find that which is neither right nor wrong. They study about good
and evil, they search for virtue, but they know nothing of that which is
beyond good and evil. They study the long and the short, but that which
is neither long nor short they know nothing of.</p>

<p>This knife has a blade, an edge and a handle. Can you lift only the
blade? Can you lift only the the edge of the blade, or the handle? The
handle, the edge and the blade are all parts of the same knife: when you
pick up the knife you get all three parts together.</p>

<p>In the same way, if you pick up that which is good, the bad must follow.
People search for goodness and try to throw away evil, but they don’t
study that which is neither good nor evil. If you don’t study this,
there can be no completion. If you pick up goodness, badness follows. If
you pick up happiness, suffering follows. The practice of clinging to
goodness and rejecting evil is the Dhamma of children, it’s like a toy.
Sure, it’s all right, you can take just this much, but if you grab onto
goodness, evil will follow. The end of this path is confused, it’s not
so good.</p>

<p>Take a simple example. You have children – now suppose you want to only
love them and never experience hatred. This is the thinking of one who
doesn’t know human nature. If you hold onto love, hatred will follow. In
the same way, people decide to study the Dhamma to develop wisdom,
studying good and evil as closely as possible. Now, having known good
and evil, what do they do? They try to cling to the good, and evil
follows. They didn’t study that which is beyond good and evil. This is
what you should study.</p>

<p>‘I’m going to be like this,’ ‘I’m going to be like that,’ but they never
say, ‘I’m not going to be anything because there really isn’t any ‘I’.
This they don’t study. All they want is goodness. If they attain
goodness, they lose themselves in it. If things get too good they’ll
start to go bad, and so people end up just swinging back and forth like
this.</p>

<p>In order to calm the mind and become aware of the perceiver of sense
impressions, we must observe it. Follow the ‘one who knows’. Train the
mind until it is pure. How pure should you make it? If it’s really pure,
the mind should be above both good and evil, above even purity. It’s
finished. That’s when the practice is finished.</p>

<p>What people call sitting in meditation is merely a temporary kind of
peace. But even in such peace there are experiences. If an experience
arises there must be someone who knows it, who looks into it, queries it
and examines it. If the mind is simply blank then that’s not so useful.
You may see some people who look very restrained and think they are
peaceful, but the real peace is not simply the peaceful mind. It’s not
the peace which says, ‘May I be happy and never experience any
suffering.’ With this kind of peace, eventually even the attainment of
happiness becomes unsatisfying. Suffering results. Only when you can
make your mind beyond both happiness and suffering will you find true
peace. That’s the true peace. This is the subject most people never
study, they never really see this one.</p>

<p>The right way to train the mind is to make it bright, to develop wisdom.
Don’t think that training the mind is simply sitting quietly. That’s the
rock covering the grass. People get drunk over it. They think that
samādhi is sitting. That’s just one of the words for samādhi. But
really, if the mind has samādhi, then walking is samādhi, sitting is
samādhi, there is samādhi in the sitting posture, in the walking
posture, in the standing and reclining postures. It’s all practice.</p>

<p>Some people complain, ‘I can’t meditate, I’m too restless. Whenever I
sit down I think of this and that. I can’t do it. I’ve got too much bad
kamma I should use up my bad kamma first and then come back and try
meditating.’ Sure, just try it. Try using up your bad kamma.</p>

<p>This is how people think. Why do they think like this? These so-called
hindrances are the things we must study. Whenever we sit, the mind
immediately goes running off. We follow it and try to bring it back and
observe it once more, then it goes off again. This is what you’re
supposed to be studying. Most people refuse to learn their lessons from
nature, like a naughty schoolboy who refuses to do his homework. They
don’t want to see the mind changing. How then are you going to develop
wisdom? We have to live with change like this. When we know that the
mind is just this way, constantly changing, when we know that this is
its nature, we will understand it. We have to know when the mind is
thinking good and bad, changing all the time, we have to know these
things. If we understand this point, then even while we are thinking we
can be at peace.</p>

<p>For example, suppose at home you have a pet monkey. Monkeys don’t stay
still for long, they like to jump around and grab onto things. That’s
how monkeys are. Now you come to the monastery and see the monkey here.
This monkey doesn’t stay still either, it jumps around just the same.
But it doesn’t bother you, does it? Why doesn’t it bother you? Because
you’ve raised a monkey before, you know what they’re like. If you know
just one monkey, no matter how many provinces you go to, no matter how
many monkeys you see, you won’t be bothered by them, will you? This is
one who understands monkeys.</p>

<p>If we understand monkeys, then we won’t become a monkey. If you don’t
understand monkeys you may become a monkey yourself! Do you understand?
When you see it reaching for this and that, you shout, ‘Hey!’ You get
angry. ‘That damned monkey!’ This is one who doesn’t know monkeys. One
who knows monkeys sees that the monkey at home and the monkey in the
monastery are just the same. Why should you get annoyed by them? When
you see what monkeys are like, that’s enough, you can be at peace.</p>

<p>Peace is like this. We must know sensations. Some sensations are
pleasant, some are unpleasant, but that’s not important. That’s just
their business. Just like the monkey, all monkeys are the same. We
understand sensations as sometimes agreeable, sometimes not – that’s
just their nature. We should understand them and know how to let them
go. Sensations are uncertain. They are transient, imperfect and
ownerless. Everything that we perceive is like this. When eyes, ears,
nose, tongue, body and mind receive sensations, we know them, just like
knowing the monkey. Then we can be at peace.</p>

<p>When sensations arise, know them. Why do you run after them? Sensations
are uncertain. One minute they are one way, the next minute another.
They exist dependent on change. And all of us here exist dependent on
change. The breath goes out, then it must come in. It must have this
change. Try only breathing in, can you do that? Or try just breathing
out without taking in another breath, can you do it? If there was no
change like this, how long could you live for? There must be both the
in-breath and the out-breath.</p>

<p>Sensations are the same. There must be these things. If there were no
sensations, you couldn’t develop wisdom. If there is no wrong, there can
be no right. You must be right first before you can see what is wrong,
and you must understand the wrong first to be right. This is how things
are.</p>

<p>For the really earnest student, the more sensations the better. But many
meditators shrink away from sensations, they don’t want to deal with
them. This is like the naughty schoolboy who won’t go to school, won’t
listen to the teacher. These sensations are teaching us. When we know
sensations, then we are practising Dhamma. The peace within sensations
is just like understanding the monkey here. When you understand what
monkeys are like, you are no longer troubled by them.</p>

<p>The practice of Dhamma is like this. It’s not that the Dhamma is very
far away, it’s right with us. The Dhamma isn’t about the angels on high
or anything like that. It’s simply about us, about what we are doing
right now. Observe yourself. Sometimes there is happiness, sometimes
suffering, sometimes comfort, sometimes pain, sometimes love, sometimes
hate. This is Dhamma. Do you see it? You should know this Dhamma, you
have to read your experiences.</p>

<p>You must know sensations before you can let them go. When you see that
sensations are impermanent you will be untroubled by them. As soon as a
sensation arises, just say to yourself, ‘Hmmm, this is not a sure
thing.’ When your mood changes, ‘Hmmm, not sure.’ You can be at peace
with these things, just like seeing the monkey and not being bothered by
it. If you know the truth of sensations, that is knowing the Dhamma. You
let go of sensations, seeing that invariably, they are all uncertain.</p>

<p>What we call uncertainty, here, is the Buddha. The Buddha is the Dhamma.
The Dhamma is the characteristic of uncertainty. Whoever sees the
uncertainty of things sees the unchanging reality of things. That’s what
the Dhamma is like. And that is the Buddha. If you see the Dhamma you
see the Buddha; seeing the Buddha, you see the Dhamma. If you know
<em>aniccaṃ</em>, (uncertainty), you will let go of things and not grasp onto
them.</p>

<p>You say, ‘Hey, don’t break my glass!’ Can you prevent something that is
breakable from breaking? If it doesn’t break now it will break later on.
If you don’t break it, someone else will. If someone else doesn’t break
it, one of the chickens will! The Buddha says to accept this. He
penetrated the truth of these things, seeing that this glass is already
broken. Whenever you use this glass you should reflect that it’s already
broken. Do you understand this? The Buddha’s understanding was like
this. He saw the broken glass within the unbroken one. Whenever its time
is up it will break. Develop this kind of understanding. Use the glass,
look after it, until when, one day, it slips out of your hand. ‘Smash!’
No problem. Why is there no problem? Because you saw its brokenness
before it broke!</p>

<p>But usually people say, ‘I love this glass so much, may it never break.’
Later on the dog breaks it. ‘I’ll kill that damn dog!’ You hate the dog
for breaking your glass. If one of your children breaks it you’ll hate
them too. Why is this? Because you’ve dammed yourself up, the water
can’t flow. You’ve made a dam without a spillway. The only thing the dam
can do is burst, right? When you make a dam you must make a spillway
also. When the water rises up too high, the water can flow off safely.
When it’s full to the brim you open your spillway. You have to have a
safety valve like this. Impermanence is the safety valve of the Noble
Ones. If you have this ‘safety valve’ you will be at peace.</p>

<p>Practise constantly, standing, walking, sitting, lying down, using sati
to watch over and protect the mind. This is samādhi and wisdom. They are
both the same thing, but they have different aspects.</p>

<p>If we really see uncertainty clearly, we will see that which is certain.
The certainty is that things must inevitably be this way, they can not
be otherwise. Do you understand? Knowing just this much you can know the
Buddha, you can rightly do reverence to him.</p>

<p>As long as you don’t throw out the Buddha you won’t suffer. As soon as
you throw out the Buddha you will experience suffering. As soon as you
throw out the reflections on transience, imperfection and ownerlessness
you’ll have suffering. If you can practise just this much it’s enough;
suffering won’t arise, or if it does arise you can settle it easily, and
it will be a cause for suffering not arising in the future. This is the
end of our practice, at the point where suffering doesn’t arise. And why
doesn’t suffering arise? Because we have sorted out the cause of
suffering, <em>samudaya</em>.</p>

<p>For instance, if this glass were to break, you would experience
suffering. We know that this glass will be a cause for suffering, so we
get rid of the cause. All dhammas arise because of a cause. They must
also cease because of a cause. So, if there is suffering on account of
this glass here, we should let go of this cause. If we reflect
beforehand that this glass is already broken, even when it isn’t, the
cause ceases. When there is no longer any cause, that suffering is no
longer able to exist; it ceases. This is cessation.</p>

<p>You don’t have to go beyond this point, just this much is enough.
Contemplate this in your own mind. Basically you should all have the
Five Precepts as a foundation for behaviour. It’s not necessary to go
and study the Tipitaka, just concentrate on the Five Precepts first. At
first you will make mistakes. When you realize it, stop, come back and
establish your precepts again. Maybe you’ll go astray and make another
mistake. When you realize it, re-establish yourself.</p>

<p>Practising like this, your sati will improve and become more consistent,
just like the drops of water falling from a kettle. If we tilt the
kettle just a little, the drops fall out slowly; plop! … plop! … plop! …
If we tilt the kettle up a little bit more, the drops become more rapid;
plop, plop, plop! … If we tilt the kettle up even further the ‘plops’ go
away and the water flows into a steady stream. Where do the ‘plops’ go
to? They don’t go anywhere, they change into a steady stream of water.</p>

<p>We have to talk about the Dhamma like this, using similes, because the
Dhamma has no form. Is it square or is it round? You can’t say. The only
way to talk about it is through similes like this. Don’t think that the
Dhamma is far away from you. It lies right with you, all around. Take a
look; one minute you are happy, the next sad, the next angry. It’s all
Dhamma. Look at it and understand. Whatever it is that causes suffering,
you should remedy. If suffering is still there, take another look, you
don’t yet see clearly. If you could see clearly you wouldn’t suffer
because the cause would no longer be there. If suffering is still there,
if you’re still having to endure, then you’re not yet on the right
track. Wherever you get stuck, whenever you’re suffering too much, right
there you’re wrong. Whenever you’re so happy you’re floating in the
clouds, there, wrong again!</p>

<p>If you practise like this, you will have sati at all times, in all
postures. With sati, and <em>sampajañña,</em> you will know right and wrong,
happiness and suffering. Knowing these things, you will know how to deal
with them.</p>

<p>I teach meditation like this. When it’s time to sit in meditation then
sit, that’s not wrong. You should practise this also. But meditation is
not only sitting. You must allow your mind to fully experience things,
allow them to flow and consider their nature. How should you consider
them? See them as transient, imperfect and ownerless. It’s all
uncertain. ‘This is so beautiful, I really must have it.’ That’s not a
sure thing. ‘I don’t like this at all’. Tell yourself right there, ‘Not
sure!’ Is this true? Absolutely, no mistake. But just try taking things
for real. ‘I’m going to get this thing for sure.’ You’ve gone off the
track already. Don’t do this. No matter how much you like something, you
should reflect that it’s uncertain.</p>

<p>Some kinds of food seem so delicious, but still you should reflect that
it’s not a sure thing. It may seem so sure, that it’s so delicious, but
still you must tell yourself, ‘Not sure!’ If you want to test out
whether it’s sure or not, try eating your favourite food every day.
Every single day, mind you. Eventually you’ll complain, ‘This doesn’t
taste so good anymore.’ Eventually you’ll think, ‘Actually I prefer that
kind of food.’ That’s not a sure thing either! You must allow things to
flow, just like the in and out breaths. There has to be both the in
breath and the out breath, the breathing depends on change. Everything
depends on change like this.</p>

<p>These things lie with us, nowhere else. If we no longer doubt, whether
sitting, standing, walking, or reclining, we will be at peace. Samādhi
isn’t just sitting. Some people sit until they fall into a stupor. They
might as well be dead, they can’t tell north from south. Don’t take it
to such an extreme. If you feel sleepy, then walk, change your posture.
Develop wisdom. If you are really tired, have a rest. As soon as you
wake up then continue the practice, don’t let yourself drift into a
stupor. You must practise like this. Have reason, wisdom,
circumspection.</p>

<p>Start the practice with your own mind and body, seeing them as
impermanent. Everything else is the same. Keep this in mind when you
think the food is so delicious, you must tell yourself, ‘Not a sure
thing!’ You have to whack it first. But usually it just whacks you every
time, doesn’t it? If you don’t like anything, you just suffer over it.
This is how things whack us. ‘If she likes me, I like her.’ They whack
us again. You never get a punch in! You must see it like this. Whenever
you like anything just say to yourself, ‘This is not a sure thing!’ You
have to go against the grain somewhat in order to really see the Dhamma.</p>

<p>Practise in all postures, sitting, standing, walking, lying. You can
experience anger in any posture, right? You can be angry while walking,
while sitting, while lying down. You can experience desire in any
posture. So our practice must extend to all postures; standing, walking,
sitting and lying down. It must be consistent. Don’t just put on a show,
really do it.</p>

<p>While sitting in meditation, some incident might arise. Before it is
settled another one comes racing in. Whenever these things come up, just
tell yourself, ‘Not sure, not sure.’ Just whack it before it gets a
chance to whack you.</p>

<p>Now this is the important point. If you know that all things are
impermanent, all your thinking will gradually unwind. When you reflect
on the uncertainty of everything that passes, you’ll see that all things
go the same way. Whenever anything arises, all you need to say is, ‘Oh,
another one!’</p>

<p>Have you ever seen flowing water? Have you ever seen still water? If
your mind is peaceful, it will be just like still, flowing water. Have
you ever seen still, flowing water? There! You’ve only ever seen flowing
water and still water, haven’t you? But you’ve never seen still, flowing
water. Right there, right where your thinking can not take you, even
though it’s peaceful you can develop wisdom. Your mind will be like
flowing water, and yet it’s still. It’s almost as if it were still, and
yet it’s flowing. So I call it ‘still, flowing water.’ Wisdom can arise
here.</p>
