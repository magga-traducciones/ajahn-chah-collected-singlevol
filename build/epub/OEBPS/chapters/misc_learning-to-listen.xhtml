<p><span class="dropcaps-first">D</span><span class="dropcaps-words">uring an informal
gathering</span>  at his residence one evening, the Ajahn said,
‘When you listen to the Dhamma, you must open up your heart and compose
yourself in its centre. Don’t try and accumulate what you hear, or make
painstaking efforts to retain it through your memory. Just let the
Dhamma flow into your heart as it reveals itself, and keep yourself
continuously open to the flow in the present moment. What is ready to be
retained will remain. It will happen of its own accord, not through
forced effort on your part.</p>

<p>Similarly, when you expound the Dhamma, there must be no force involved.
The Dhamma must flow spontaneously from the present moment according to
circumstances. You know, it’s strange, but sometimes people come to me
and really show no apparent desire to hear the Dhamma, but there it is –
it just happens. The Dhamma comes flowing out with no effort whatsoever.
Then at other times, people seem to be quite keen to listen. They even
formally ask for a discourse, and then, nothing! It just won’t happen.
What can you do? I don’t know why it is, but I know that things happen
in this way. It’s as though people have different levels of receptivity,
and when you are there at the same level, things just happen.</p>

<p>If you must expound the Dhamma, the best way is not to think about it at
all. Simply forget it. The more you think and try to plan, the worse it
will be. This is hard to do, though, isn’t it? Sometimes, when you’re
flowing along quite smoothly, there will be a pause, and someone may ask
a question. Then, suddenly, there’s a whole new direction. There seems
to be an unlimited source that you can never exhaust.</p>

<p>I believe without a doubt in the Buddha’s ability to know the
temperaments and receptivity of other beings. He used this very same
method of spontaneous teaching. It’s not that he needed to use any
superhuman power, but rather that he was sensitive to the needs of the
people around him and so taught to them accordingly. An instance
demonstrating his own spontaneity occurred when once, after he had
expounded the Dhamma to a group of his disciples, he asked them if they
had ever heard this teaching before. They replied that they had not. He
then went on to say that he himself had also never heard it before.</p>

<p>Just continue your practice no matter what you are doing. Practice is
not dependent on any one posture, such as sitting or walking. Rather, it
is a continuous awareness of the flow of your own consciousness and
feelings. No matter what is happening, just compose yourself and always
be mindfully aware of that flow.</p>

<p>Later, the Ajahn went on to say, ‘Practice is not moving forward, but
there is forward movement. At the same time, it is not moving back, but
there is backward movement. And, finally, practice is not stopping and
being still, but there is stopping and being still. So there is moving
forward and backward as well as being still, but you can’t say that it
is any one of the three. Then practice eventually comes to a point where
there is neither forward nor backward movement, nor any being still.
Where is that?’</p>

<p>On another informal occasion, he said, ‘To define Buddhism without a lot
of words and phrases, we can simply say, “Don’t cling or hold on to
anything. Harmonize with actuality, with things just as they are.”’</p>
