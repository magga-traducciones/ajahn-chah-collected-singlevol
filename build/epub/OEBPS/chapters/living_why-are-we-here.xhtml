<p><span class="dropcaps-first">T</span><span class="dropcaps-words">his Rains Retreat</span>  I
don’t have much strength, I’m not well, so I’ve come up to this mountain
here to get some fresh air. People come to visit but I can’t really
receive them like I used to because my voice has just about had it, my
breath is just about gone. You can count it a blessing that there is
still this body sitting here for you all to see now. This is a blessing
in itself. Soon you won’t see it. The breath will be finished, the voice
will be gone. They will fare in accordance with supporting factors, like
all compounded things. The Lord Buddha called it <em>khaya-vayaṃ</em>, the
decline and dissolution of all conditioned phenomena.</p>

<p>How do they decline? Consider a lump of ice. Originally it was simply
water; people freeze it and it becomes ice. But it doesn’t take long
before it’s melted. Take a big lump of ice, say as big as this tape
recorder here, and leave it out in the sun. You can see how it declines,
much the same as the body. It will gradually disintegrate. After not
many hours or minutes all that’s left is a puddle of water. This is
called <em>khaya-vayaṃ</em>, the decline and dissolution of all compounded
things. It’s been this way for a long time now, ever since the beginning
of time. When we are born we bring this inherent nature into the world
with us, we can’t avoid it. At birth we bring old age, sickness and
death along with us.</p>

<p>So this is why the Buddha said <em>khaya-vayaṃ</em>, the decline and
dissolution of all compounded things. All of us sitting here in this
hall now, monks, novices, laymen and laywomen, are without exception
‘lumps of deterioration’. Right now the lump is hard, just like the lump
of ice. It starts out as water, becomes ice for a while and then melts
again. Can you see this decline in yourself? Look at this body. It’s
ageing every day – hair is ageing, nails are ageing – everything is
ageing!</p>

<p>You weren’t like this before, were you? You were probably much smaller
than this. Now you’ve grown up and matured. From now on you will
decline, following the way of nature. The body declines just like the
lump of ice. Soon, just like the lump of ice, it’s all gone. All bodies
are composed of the four elements of earth, water, wind and fire. A body
is the confluence of earth, water, wind, and fire, which we proceed to
call a person. Originally it’s hard to say what you could call it, but
now we call it a ‘person’. We get infatuated with it, saying it’s a
male, a female, giving it names, Mr, Mrs, and so on, so that we can
identify each other more easily. But actually there isn’t anybody there.
There’s earth, water, wind and fire. When they come together in this
known form we call the result a ‘person’. Now don’t get excited over it.
If you really look into it there isn’t anyone there.</p>

<p>That which is solid in the body, the flesh, skin, bones and so on, are
called the earth element. Those aspects of the body which are liquid are
the water element. The faculty of warmth in the body is the fire
element, while the winds coursing through the body are the wind element.</p>

<p>At Wat Pah Pong we have a body which is neither male or female: it’s the
skeleton hanging in the main hall. Looking at it you don’t get the
feeling that it’s a man or a woman. People ask each other whether it’s a
man or a woman and all they can do is look blankly at each other. It’s
only a skeleton, all the skin and flesh are gone.</p>

<p>People are ignorant of these things. Some go to Wat Pah Pong, into the
main hall, see the skeletons and then come running right out again! They
can’t bear to look. They’re afraid, afraid of the skeletons. I figure
these people have never seen themselves before. Because they are afraid
of the skeletons, they don’t reflect on the great value of a skeleton.
To get to the monastery they had to ride in a car or walk; if they
didn’t have bones how would they be? Would they be able to walk about
like that? But they ride their cars to Wat Pah Pong, go into the main
hall, see the skeleton and run straight back out again! They’ve never
seen such a thing before. They’re born with it and yet they’ve never
seen it. It’s very fortunate that they have a chance to see it now. Even
older people see the skeleton and get scared. What’s all the fuss about?
This shows that they’re not at all in touch with themselves, they don’t
really know themselves. Maybe they go home and still can’t sleep for
three or four days, and yet they’re sleeping with a skeleton! They get
dressed with it, eat food with it, do everything with it, and yet
they’re scared of it.</p>

<p>This shows how out of touch people are with themselves. How pitiful!
They’re always looking outwards, at trees, at other people, at external
objects, saying ‘this one is big,’ ‘that’s small,’ ‘that’s short,’
‘that’s long.’ They’re so busy looking at other things they never see
themselves. To be honest, people are really pitiful; they have no
refuge.</p>

<p>In the ordination ceremonies the ordinees must learn the five basic
meditation themes: <em>kesā</em>, head hair; <em>lomā</em>, body hair; <em>nakhā</em>, nails;
<em>dantā</em>, teeth; <em>taco</em>, skin. Some of the students and educated people
snigger to themselves when they hear this part of the ordination
ceremony. ‘What’s the Ajahn trying to teach us here? Teaching us about
hair when we’ve had it for ages. He doesn’t have to teach us about this,
we know it already. Why bother teaching us something we already know?’
Dim people are like this, they think they can see the hair already. I
tell them that when I say to ‘see the hair’ I mean to see it <em>as it
really is</em>. See body hair as it really is, see nails, teeth and skin as
they really are. That’s what I call ‘seeing’ – not seeing in a
superficial way, but seeing in accordance with the truth. We wouldn’t be
so sunk up to the ears in things if we could see things as they really
are. Hair, nails, teeth, skin – what are they really like? Are they
pretty? Are they clean? Do they have any real substance? Are they
stable? No, there’s nothing to them. They’re not pretty but we imagine
them to be so. They’re not substantial but we imagine them to be so.</p>

<p>Hair, nails, teeth, skin – people are really hooked on these things. The
Buddha established these things as the basic themes for meditation, he
taught us to know these things. They are transient, imperfect and
ownerless; they are not ‘me’ or ‘them’. We are born with and deluded by
these things, but really they are foul. Suppose we didn’t bathe for a
week, could we bear to be close to each other? We’d really smell bad.
When people sweat a lot, such as when a lot of people are working hard
together, the smell is awful. We go back home and rub ourselves down
with soap and water and the smell abates somewhat, the fragrance of the
soap replaces it. Rubbing soap on the body may make it seem fragrant,
but actually the bad smell of the body is still there, it is just
temporarily suppressed. When the smell of the soap is gone the smell of
the body comes back again.</p>

<p>Now we tend to think these bodies are pretty, delightful, long lasting
and strong. We tend to think that we will never age, get sick or die. We
are charmed and fooled by the body, and so we are ignorant of the true
refuge within ourselves. The true place of refuge is the mind. The mind
is our true refuge. This hall here may be pretty big but it can’t be a
true refuge. Pigeons take shelter here, geckos take shelter here,
lizards take shelter here. We may think the hall belongs to us but it
doesn’t. We live here together with everything else. This is only a
temporary shelter, soon we must leave it. People take these shelters for
refuge.</p>

<p>So the Buddha said to find your refuge. That means to find your real
heart. This heart is very important. People don’t usually look at
important things, they spend most of their time looking at unimportant
things. For example, when they do the house cleaning they may be bent on
cleaning up the house, washing the dishes and so on, but they fail to
notice their own hearts. Their heart may be rotten, they may be feeling
angry, washing the dishes with a sour expression on their face. They
fail to see that their own hearts are not very clean. This is what I
call ‘taking a temporary shelter for a refuge’. They beautify house and
home but they don’t think of beautifying their own hearts. They don’t
examine suffering. The heart is the important thing. The Buddha taught
to find a refuge within your own heart: <em>Attā hi attano nātho</em> – ‘Make
yourself a refuge unto yourself.’ Who else can be your refuge? The true
refuge is the heart, nothing else. You may try to depend on other
things, but they aren’t a sure thing. You can only really depend on
other things if you already have a refuge within yourself. You must have
your own refuge first before you can depend on anything else, be it a
teacher, family, friends or relatives.</p>

<p>So all of you, both laypeople and homeless ones who have come to visit
today, please consider this teaching. Ask yourselves, ‘Who am I? Why am
I here?’ Ask yourselves, ‘Why was I born?’ Some people don’t know. They
want to be happy but the suffering never stops. Rich or poor, young or
old, they suffer just the same. It’s all suffering. And why? Because
they have no wisdom. The poor are unhappy because they don’t have
enough, and the rich are unhappy because they have too much to look
after.</p>

<p>In the past, as a young novice, I gave a Dhamma discourse. I talked
about the happiness of wealth and possessions, having servants and so on
… a hundred male servants, a hundred female servants, a hundred
elephants, a hundred cows, a hundred buffaloes … a hundred of
everything! The laypeople really lapped it up. But can you imagine
looking after a hundred buffaloes? Or a hundred cows, a hundred male and
female servants? Can you imagine having to look after all of that? Would
that be fun? People don’t consider this side of things. They have the
desire to possess, to have the cows, the buffaloes, the servants, to
have hundreds of them. But I say fifty buffaloes would be too much. Just
twining the rope for all those brutes would be too much already! But
people don’t consider this, they only think of the pleasure of
acquiring. They don’t consider the trouble involved.</p>

<p>If we don’t have wisdom, everything round us will be a source of
suffering. If we are wise these things – eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body
and mind – will lead us out of suffering. Eyes aren’t necessarily good
things, you know. If you are in a bad mood just seeing other people can
make you angry and make you lose sleep. Or you can fall in love with
others. Love is suffering too, if you don’t get what you want. Love and
hate are both suffering, because of desire. Wanting is suffering,
wanting not to have is suffering. Wanting to acquire things, even if you
get them it’s still suffering because you’re afraid you’ll lose them.
There’s only suffering. How are you going to live with that? You may
have a large, luxurious house, but if your heart isn’t good it never
really works out as you expected.</p>

<p>Therefore, you should all take a look at yourselves. Why were we born?
Do we ever really attain anything in this life? In the countryside here
people start planting rice right from childhood. When they reach
seventeen or eighteen they rush off and get married, afraid they won’t
have enough time to make their fortunes. They start working from an
early age thinking they’ll get rich that way. They plant rice until
they’re seventy or eighty or even ninety years old. I ask them, ‘From
the day you were born you’ve been working. Now it’s almost time to go,
what are you going to take with you?’ They don’t know what to say. All
they can say is, ‘beats me!’ We have a saying in these parts, ‘Don’t
tarry picking berries along the way, before you know it, night falls.’
Just because of this ‘beats me!’ They’re neither here nor there, content
with just a ‘beats me’ sitting among the branches of the berry tree,
gorging themselves with berries. ‘Beats me, beats me.’</p>

<p>When you’re still young you think that being single is not so good, you
feel a bit lonely. So you find a partner to live with. Put two together
and there’s friction! Living alone is too quiet, but living with others
there’s friction.</p>

<p>When children are small the parents think, ‘When they get bigger we’ll
be better off.’ They raise their children, three, four, or five of them,
thinking that when the children are grown up their burden will be
lighter. But when the children grow up they get even heavier. Like two
pieces of wood, one big and one small. You throw away the small one and
take the bigger one, thinking it will be lighter, but of course it’s
not. When children are small they don’t bother you very much, just a
ball of rice and a banana now and then. When they grow up they want a
motorcycle or a car! Well, you love your children, you can’t refuse. So
you try to give them what they want. Sometimes the parents get into
arguments over it. ‘Don’t go and buy him a car, we haven’t got enough
money!’ But when you love your children you’ve got to borrow the money
from somewhere. Maybe the parents even have to go without to get the
things their children want. Then there’s education. ‘When they’ve
finished their studies, we’ll be all right.’ There’s no end to the
studying! What are they going to finish? Only in the science of Buddhism
is there a point of completion, all the other sciences just go round in
circles. In the end it’s a real headache. If there’s a house with four
or five children in it the parents argue every day.</p>

<p>The suffering that is waiting in the future we fail to see, we think it
will never happen. When it happens, then we know. That kind of
suffering, the suffering inherent in our bodies, is hard to foresee.
When I was a child minding the buffaloes I’d take charcoal and rub it on
my teeth to make them white. I’d go back home and look in the mirror and
see them so nice and white. I was getting fooled by my own bones, that’s
all. When I reached fifty or sixty my teeth started to get loose. When
the teeth start falling out it hurts so much. When you eat it feels as
if you’ve been kicked in the mouth. It really hurts. I’ve been through
this one already. So I just got the dentist to take them all out. Now
I’ve got false teeth. My real teeth were giving me so much trouble I
just had them all taken out, sixteen in one go. The dentist was
reluctant to take out sixteen teeth at once, but I said to him, ‘Just
take them out, I’ll take the consequences.’ So he took them all out at
once. Some were still good, too, at least five of them. He took them all
out. But it was really touch and go. After having them out I couldn’t
eat any food for two or three days.</p>

<p>Before, as a young child minding the buffaloes, I used to think that
polishing the teeth was a great thing to do. I loved my teeth, I thought
they were good things. But in the end they had to go. The pain almost
killed me. I suffered from toothache for months, years. Sometimes both
my gums were swollen at once.</p>

<p>Some of you may get a chance to experience this for yourselves someday.
If your teeth are still good and you’re brushing them everyday to keep
them nice and white, watch out! They may start playing tricks with you
later on.</p>

<p>I’m just letting you know about these things – the suffering that arises
from within, that arises within our own bodies. There’s nothing within
the body you can depend on. It’s not too bad when you’re still young,
but as you get older things begin to break down. Everything begins to
fall apart. Conditions go their natural way. Whether we laugh or cry
over them they just go on their way. It makes no difference how we live
or die, makes no difference to them. And there’s no knowledge or science
which can prevent this natural course of things. You may get a dentist
to look at your teeth, but even if he can fix them they still eventually
go their natural way. Eventually even the dentist has the same trouble.
Everything falls apart in the end.</p>

<p>These are things which we should contemplate while we still have some
vigour; we should practise while we’re young. If you want to make merit
then hurry up and do so, don’t just leave it up to the oldies. Most
people just wait until they get old before they will go to a monastery
and try to practise Dhamma. Women and men say the same thing, ‘Wait till
I get old first.’ I don’t know why they say that. Does an old person
have much vigour? Let them try racing with a young person and see what
the difference is. Why do they leave it till they get old? Just like
they’re never going to die. When they get to fifty or sixty years old or
more, ‘Hey, Grandma! Let’s go to the monastery!’ ‘You go ahead, my ears
aren’t so good anymore.’ You see what I mean? When her ears were good
what was she listening to? ‘Beats me!’ she was just dallying with the
berries. Finally when her ears are gone she goes to the temple. It’s
hopeless. She listens to the sermon but she hasn’t got a clue what
they’re saying. People wait till they’re all used up before they’ll
think of practising the Dhamma.</p>

<p>Today’s talk may be useful for those of you who can understand it. These
are things which you should begin to observe, they are our inheritance.
They will gradually get heavier and heavier, a burden for each of us to
bear. In the past my legs were strong, I could run. Now just walking
around they feel heavy. Before, my legs carried me. Now, I have to carry
them. When I was a child I’d see old people getting up from their seat.
‘Oh!’ Getting up they groan, ‘Oh!’ There’s always this ‘Oh!’ But they
don’t know what it is that makes them groan like that. Even when it gets
to this extent people don’t see the bane of the body. You never know
when you’re going to be parted from it. What’s causing all the pain is
simply conditions going about their natural way. People call it
arthritis, rheumatism, gout and so on, the doctor prescribes medicines,
but it never completely heals. In the end it falls apart, even the
doctor! This is conditions faring along their natural course. This is
their way, their nature.</p>

<p>Now take a look at this. If you see it in advance you’ll be better off,
like seeing a poisonous snake on the path ahead of you. If you see it
there you can get out of its way and not get bitten. If you don’t see it
you may keep on walking and step on it. And then it bites.</p>

<p>If suffering arises people don’t know what to do. Where to go to treat
it? They want to avoid suffering, they want to be free of it but they
don’t know how to treat it when it arises. And they live on like this
until they get old, and sick, and die.</p>

<p>In olden times it was said that if someone was mortally ill one of the
next of kin should whisper ‘<em>Bud-dho</em>, <em>Bud-dho</em>’ in their ear. What are
they going to do with <em>Buddho</em>? What good is <em>Buddho</em> going to be for
them when they’re almost on the funeral pyre? Why didn’t they learn
<em>Buddho</em> when they were young and healthy? Now with the breaths coming
fitfully you go up and say, ‘Mother, <em>Buddho, Buddho</em>!’ Why waste your
time? You’ll only confuse her, let her go peacefully.</p>

<p>People don’t know how to solve problems within their own hearts, they
don’t have a refuge. They get angry easily and have a lot of desires.
Why is this? Because they have no refuge.</p>

<p>When people are newly married they can get on together all right, but
after age fifty or so they can’t understand each other. Whatever the
wife says the husband finds intolerable. Whatever the husband says the
wife won’t listen. They turn their backs on each other.</p>

<p>Now I’m just talking because I’ve never had a family. Why haven’t I had
a family? Just looking at this word ‘household’<sup id="fnref_1"><a href="#fn_1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> I knew what it was
all about. What is a ‘household’? This is a ‘hold’: if somebody were to
get some rope and tie us up while we were sitting here, what would that
be like? That’s called ‘being held’. Whatever that’s like, ‘being held’
is like that. There is a circle of confinement. The man lives within his
circle of confinement, and the woman lives within her circle of
confinement.</p>

<p>When I read this word ‘household’, this is a heavy one. This word is no
trifling matter, it’s a real killer. The word ‘hold’ is a symbol of
suffering. You can’t go anywhere, you’ve got to stay within your circle
of confinement.</p>

<p>Now we come to the word ‘house’. This means ‘that which hassles’. Have
you ever toasted chillies? The whole house chokes and sneezes. This word
‘household’ spells confusion, it’s not worth the trouble. Because of
this word I was able to ordain and not disrobe. ‘Household’ is
frightening. You’re stuck and can’t go anywhere. Problems with the
children, with money and all the rest. But where can you go? You’re tied
down. There are sons and daughters, arguments in profusion until your
dying day, and there’s nowhere else to go to no matter how much
suffering it is. The tears pour out and they keep pouring. The tears
will never be finished with this ‘household’, you know. If there’s no
household you might be able to finish with the tears but not otherwise.</p>

<p>Consider this matter. If you haven’t come across it yet you may later
on. Some people have experienced it already to a certain extent. Some
are already at the end of their tether. ‘Will I stay or will I go?’ At
Wat Pah Pong there are about seventy or eighty kuṭīs. When they’re
almost full I tell the monk in charge to keep a few empty, just in case
somebody has an argument with their spouse. Sure enough, in no long time
a lady will arrive with her bags. ‘I’m fed up with the world, Luang
Por.’ ‘Whoa! Don’t say that. Those words are really heavy.’ Then the
husband comes and says he’s fed up too. After two or three days in the
monastery their world-weariness disappears.</p>

<p>They say they’re fed up but they’re just fooling themselves. When they
go off to a kuṭī and sit in the quiet by themselves, after a while the
thoughts come: ‘When is the wife going to come and ask me to go home?’
They don’t really know what’s going on. What is this ‘world-weariness’
of theirs? They get upset over something and come running to the
monastery. At home everything looked wrong; the husband was wrong, the
wife was wrong, but after three days’ quiet thinking, ‘Hmm, the wife was
right after all, it was I who was wrong.’ ‘Hubby was right, I shouldn’t
have got so upset.’ They change sides. This is how it is, that’s why I
don’t take the world too seriously. I know its ins and outs already,
that’s why I’ve chosen to live as a monk.</p>

<p>I would like to present today’s talk to all of you for homework. Whether
you’re in the fields or working in the city, take these words and
consider them: ‘Why was I born? What can I take with me?’ Ask yourselves
over and over. If you ask yourself these questions often you’ll become
wise. If you don’t reflect on these things you will remain ignorant.
Listening to today’s talk, you may get some understanding, if not now,
then maybe when you get home. Perhaps this evening. When you’re
listening to the talk everything is subdued, but maybe things are
waiting for you in the car. When you get in the car it may get in with
you. When you get home it may all become clear. ‘Oh, that’s what Luang
Por meant. I couldn’t see it before.’</p>

<p>I think that’s enough for today. If I talk too long this old body gets
tired.</p>
