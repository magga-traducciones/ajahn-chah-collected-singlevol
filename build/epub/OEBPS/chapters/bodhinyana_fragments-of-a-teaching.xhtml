<h1 id="fragments-of-a-teaching">Fragments of a Teaching</h1>

<p><span class="dropcaps-first">A</span><span class="dropcaps-words">ll of you have
believed</span>  in Buddhism for many years now through hearing
about the Buddhist teachings from many sources – especially from various
monks and teachers. In some cases Dhamma is taught in very broad and
vague terms to the point where it is difficult to know how to put it
into practice in daily life. In other instances Dhamma is taught in high
language or special jargon to the point where most people find it
difficult to understand, especially if the teaching is drawn too
literally from scripture. Lastly Dhamma is taught in a balanced way,
neither too vague nor too profound, neither too broad nor too esoteric –
just right for the listener to understand and practise to personally
benefit from the teachings. Today I would like to share with you
teachings of the sort I have often used to instruct my disciples in the
past; teachings which I hope may possibly be of personal benefit to
those of you listening here today.</p>

<h2 id="one-who-wishes-to-reach-the-buddha-dhamma">One Who Wishes to Reach the Buddha-Dhamma</h2>

<p>One who wishes to reach the Buddha-Dhamma must be one who has faith or
confidence as a foundation. He must understand the meaning of
Buddha-Dhamma as follows:</p>

<p>‘Buddha’ is the ‘one-who-knows’, the one who has purity, radiance and
peace in his heart.</p>

<p>‘Dhamma’ means the characteristics of purity, radiance and peace which
arise from morality, concentration and wisdom.</p>

<p>Therefore, one who is to reach the Buddha-Dhamma is one who cultivates
and develops morality, concentration and wisdom within himself.</p>

<h2 id="walking-the-path-of-buddha-dhamma">Walking the Path of Buddha-Dhamma</h2>

<p>Naturally people who wish to reach their home are not those who merely
sit and think of travelling. They must actually undertake the process of
travelling step by step, and in the right direction as well, in order to
finally reach home. If they take the wrong path they may eventually run
into difficulties such as swamps or other obstacles which are hard to
get around. Or they may run into dangerous situations in this wrong
direction, thereby possibly never reaching home.</p>

<p>Those who reach home can relax and sleep comfortably – home is a place
of comfort for body and mind. Now they have really reached home. But if
the traveller only passed by the front of his home or only walked around
it, he would not receive any benefit from having travelled all the way
home.</p>

<p>In the same way, walking the path to reach the Buddha-Dhamma is
something each one of us must do individually, for no one can do it for
us. And we must travel along the proper path of morality, concentration
and wisdom until we find the blessings of purity, radiance and
peacefulness of mind that are the fruits of travelling the path.</p>

<p>However, if one only has knowledge of books and scriptures, sermons and
suttas, that is, only knowledge of the map or plans for the journey,
even in hundreds of lives one will never know purity, radiance and
peacefulness of mind. Instead one will just waste time and never get to
the real benefits of practice. Teachers are those who only point out the
direction of the path. After listening to the teachers, whether or not
we walk the path by practising ourselves, and thereby reap the fruits of
practice, is strictly up to each one of us.</p>

<p>Another way to look at it is to compare practice to a bottle of medicine
a doctor leaves for his patient. On the bottle is written detailed
instructions on how to take the medicine, but no matter how many hundred
times the patient reads the directions, he is bound to die if that is
all he does. He will gain no benefit from the medicine. And before he
dies he may complain bitterly that the doctor wasn’t any good, that the
medicine didn’t cure him! He will think that the doctor was a fake or
that the medicine was worthless, yet he has only spent his time
examining the bottle and reading the instructions. He hasn’t followed
the advice of the doctor and taken the medicine.</p>

<p>However, if the patient actually follows the doctor’s advice and takes
the medicine regularly as prescribed, he will recover. And if he is very
ill, it will be necessary to take a lot of medicine, whereas if he is
only mildly ill, only a little medicine will be needed to finally cure
him. The fact that we must use a lot of medicine is a result of the
severity of our illness. It’s only natural and you can see it for
yourself with careful consideration.</p>

<p>Doctors prescribe medicine to eliminate disease from the body. The
teachings of the Buddha are prescribed to cure disease of the mind; to
bring it back to its natural healthy state. So the Buddha can be
considered to be a doctor who prescribes cures for the ills of the mind.
He is, in fact, the greatest doctor in the world.</p>

<p>Mental ills are found in each one of us without exception. When you see
these mental ills, does it not make sense to look to the Dhamma as
support, as medicine to cure your ills? Travelling the path of the
Buddha-Dhamma is not done with the body. To reach the benefits, you must
travel with the mind. We can divide these travellers into three groups:</p>

<p>First level: this group is comprised of those who understand that they
must practise themselves, and know how to do so. They take the Buddha,
Dhamma and Saṅgha as their refuge and have resolved to practise
diligently according to the teachings. These persons have discarded
merely following customs and traditions, and instead use reason to
examine for themselves the nature of the world. These are the group of
‘Buddhist believers’.</p>

<p>Middle level: this group is comprised of those who have practised until
they have an unshakable faith in the teachings of the Buddha, the Dhamma
and the Saṅgha. They also have penetrated to the understanding of the
true nature of all compounded formations. These persons gradually reduce
clinging and attachment. They do not hold onto things and their minds
reach deep understanding of the Dhamma. Depending upon the degree of
non-attachment and wisdom they are progressively known as
stream-enterers, once-returners and non-returners, or simply, noble
ones.</p>

<p>Highest level: this is the group of those whose practice has led them to
the body, speech and mind of the Buddha. They are above the world, free
of the world, and free of all attachment and clinging. They are known as
arahants or free ones, the highest level of the noble ones.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-purify-ones-morality">How to Purify One’s Morality</h2>

<p>Morality is restraint and discipline of body and speech. On the formal
level this is divided into classes of precepts for laypeople and for
monks and nuns. However, to speak in general terms, there is one basic
characteristic – that is intention. When we are mindful or
self-recollected, we have right intention. Practising mindfulness (sati)
and self-recollection (<em>sampajañña</em>) will generate good morality.</p>

<p>It is only natural that when we put on dirty clothes and our bodies are
dirty, our minds too will feel uncomfortable and depressed. However, if
we keep our bodies clean and wear clean, neat clothes, it makes our
minds light and cheerful. So too, when morality is not kept, our bodily
actions and speech are dirty, and this is a cause for making the mind
unhappy, distressed and heavy. We are separated from right practice and
this prevents us from penetrating the essence of the Dhamma in our
minds. Wholesome bodily actions and speech themselves depend on mind,
properly trained, since mind orders body and speech. Therefore, we must
continually practise by training our minds.</p>

<h2 id="the-practice-of-concentration">The Practice of Concentration</h2>

<p>The training in concentration (samādhi) is practised to make the mind
firm and steady. This brings about peacefulness of mind. Usually our
untrained minds are moving and restless, hard to control and manage.
Mind follows sense distractions wildly just like water flowing this way
and that, seeking the lowest level. Agriculturists and engineers,
though, know how to control water so that it is of greater use to
mankind. Men are clever, they know how to dam water, make large
reservoirs and canals – all of this merely to channel water and make it
more usable. In addition, the water stored becomes a source of
electrical power and light; and a further benefit from controlling its
flow is that the water doesn’t run wild, eventually settling into a few
low spots, its usefulness wasted.</p>

<p>So, too, the mind which is dammed and controlled, trained constantly,
will be of immeasurable benefit. The Buddha himself taught, ‘The mind
that has been controlled brings true happiness, so train your minds well
for the highest of benefits.’ Similarly, the animals we see around us –
elephants, horses, cattle, buffalo, etc. – must be trained before they
can be useful for work. Only after they have been trained is their
strength of benefit to us.</p>

<p>In the same way, the mind that has been trained will bring many more
times the number of blessings than that of an untrained mind. The Buddha
and his noble disciples all started out in the same way as us – with
untrained minds; but look how they became the subjects of reverence for
us all, and see how much benefit we can gain through their teaching.
Indeed, see what benefit has come to the entire world from these men who
have gone through the training of the mind to reach the freedom beyond.
The mind controlled and trained is better equipped to help us in all
professions, in all situations. The disciplined mind will keep our lives
balanced, make work easier and develop and nurture reason to govern our
actions. In the end our happiness will increase accordingly as we follow
the proper mind training.</p>

<h2 id="mindfulness-and-breathing">Mindfulness and Breathing</h2>

<p>The training of the mind can be done in many ways, with many different
methods. The method which is most useful and can be practised by all
types of people is known as ‘mindfulness of breathing’. It is the
developing of mindfulness on the in-breath and the out-breath. In this
monastery we concentrate our attention on the tip of the nose and
develop awareness of the in-breath and out-breath with the mantra word
<em>‘Bud-dho’.</em> If the meditator wishes to use another word, or simply be
mindful of the air moving in and out, this is also fine. Adjust the
practice to suit yourself. The essential factor in the meditation is
that the noting or awareness of the breath be kept up in the present
moment so that one is mindful of each in-breath and each out-breath just
as it occurs. While doing walking meditation we try to be constantly
mindful of the sensation of the feet touching the ground.</p>

<p>This practice of meditation must be pursued as continuously as possible
in order for it to bear fruit. Don’t meditate for a short time one day
and then in one or two weeks, or even a month, meditate again. This will
not bring results. The Buddha taught us to practise often, to practise
diligently, that is, to be as continuous as we can in the practice of
mental training. To practise meditation we should also find a suitably
quiet place free from distractions. In gardens or under shady trees in
our back yards, or in places where we can be alone are suitable
environments. If we are a monk or nun we should find a suitable hut, a
quiet forest or cave. The mountains offer exceptionally suitable places
for practice.</p>

<p>In any case, wherever we are, we must make an effort to be continuously
mindful of breathing in and breathing out. If the attention wanders to
other things, try to pull it back to the object of concentration. Try to
put away all other thoughts and cares. Don’t think about anything – just
watch the breath. If we are mindful of thoughts as soon as they arise
and keep diligently returning to the meditation subject, the mind will
become quieter and quieter.</p>

<p>When the mind is peaceful and concentrated, release it from the breath
as the object of concentration. Now begin to examine the body and mind
comprised of the five khandhas: material form, feelings, perceptions,
mental formations and consciousness. Examine these five khandhas as they
come and go. You will see clearly that they are impermanent, that this
impermanence makes them unsatisfactory and undesirable, and that they
come and go of their own – there is no ‘self’ running things. There is
to be found only nature moving according to cause and effect. All things
in the world fall under the characteristics of instability,
unsatisfactoriness and being without a permanent ego or soul. Seeing the
whole of existence in this light, attachment and clinging to the
khandhas will gradually be reduced. This is because we see the true
characteristics of the world. We call this the arising of wisdom.</p>

<h2 id="the-arising-of-wisdom">The Arising of Wisdom</h2>

<p>Wisdom (paññā) is to see the truth of the various manifestations of body
and mind. When we use our trained and concentrated minds to examine the
five khandhas, we will see clearly that both body and mind are
impermanent, unsatisfactory and soul-less. In seeing all compounded
things with wisdom we do not cling or grasp at them. Whatever we
receive, we receive mindfully. We are not excessively happy. When things
of ours break up or disappear, we are not unhappy and do not suffer
painful feelings – for we see clearly the impermanent nature of all
things. When we encounter illness and pain of any sort, we have
equanimity because our minds have been well trained. The true refuge is
the trained mind.</p>

<p>All of this is known as the wisdom which knows the true characteristics
of things as they arise. Wisdom arises from mindfulness and
concentration. Concentration arises from a base of morality or virtue.
Morality, concentration and wisdom are so inter-related that it is not
really possible to separate them. In practice it can be looked at in
this way: first, there is the disciplining of the mind to be attentive
to breathing. This is the arising of morality. When mindfulness of
breathing is practised continuously until the mind is quiet, this is the
arising of concentration. Then examination showing the breath as
impermanent, unsatisfactory and not-self, and the subsequent
non-attachment to it, is the arising of wisdom. Thus the practice of
mindfulness of breathing can be said to be a course for the development
of morality, concentration and wisdom. They all come together.</p>

<p>When morality, concentration and wisdom are all developed, we call this
practising the eightfold path which the Buddha taught as our only way
out of suffering. The eightfold path is above all others because if
properly practised, it leads directly to Nibbāna, to peace. We can say
that this practice reaches the Buddha-Dhamma truly and precisely.</p>

<h2 id="benefits-from-practice">Benefits from Practice</h2>

<p>When we have practised meditation as explained above, the fruits of
practice will arise in the following three stages:</p>

<p>First, for those practitioners who are at the level of ‘Buddhist by
faith’, there will arise increasing faith in the Buddha, Dhamma and
Saṅgha. This faith will become the real inner support of each person.
Also, they will understand the cause-and-effect nature of all things,
that wholesome action brings a wholesome result and that unwholesome
action brings an unwholesome result. So, for such persons, there will be
a great increase in happiness and mental peace.</p>

<p>Second, those who have reached the noble attainments of stream-winner,
once-returner or non-returner, will have unshakable faith in the Buddha,
Dhamma and Saṅgha. They are joyful and are pulled towards Nibbāna.</p>

<p>Third, for those arahants or perfected ones, there will be the happiness
free from all suffering. These are the Buddhas, free from the world,
complete in the faring of the holy way.</p>

<p>We have all had the good fortune to be born as human beings and to hear
the teachings of the Buddha. This is an opportunity that millions of
other beings do not have. Therefore, do not be careless or heedless.
Hurry and develop merits, do good and follow the path of practice in the
beginning, in the middle and in the highest levels. Don’t let time roll
by unused and without purpose. Try to reach the truth of the Buddha’s
teachings even today. Let me close with a Lao folk-saying: <em>‘many rounds
of merriment and pleasure past, soon it will be evening. Drunk with
tears now, rest and see, soon it will be too late to finish the
journey.’</em></p>
