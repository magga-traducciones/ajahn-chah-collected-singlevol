‘<em>About This Mind</em>’</p>

<p><span class="dropcaps-first">T</span><span class="dropcaps-words">raining this mind</span>  –
actually there’s nothing much to this mind. It’s simply radiant in and
of itself. It’s naturally peaceful. Why the mind doesn’t feel peaceful
right now is because it gets lost in its own moods. There’s nothing to
the mind itself. It simply abides in its natural state, that’s all. That
sometimes the mind feels peaceful and other times not peaceful is
because it has been tricked by these moods. The untrained mind lacks
wisdom. It’s foolish. Moods come and trick it into feeling pleasure one
minute and suffering the next. Happiness then sadness. But the natural
state of a person’s mind isn’t one of happiness or sadness. This
experience of happiness and sadness is not the actual mind itself, but
just these moods which have tricked it. The mind gets lost, carried away
by these moods with no idea what’s happening. And as a result, we
experience pleasure and pain accordingly, because the mind has not been
trained yet. It still isn’t very clever. And we go on thinking that it’s
our mind which is suffering or our mind which is happy, when actually
it’s just lost in its various moods.</p>

<p>The point is that really this mind of ours is naturally peaceful. It’s
still and calm like a leaf that is not being blown about by the wind.
But if the wind blows, then it flutters. It does that because of the
wind. And so with the mind it’s because of these moods – getting caught
up with thoughts. If the mind didn’t get lost in these moods, it
wouldn’t flutter about. If it understood the nature of thoughts, it
would just stay still. This is called the natural state of the mind. And
why we have come to practise now is to see the mind in this original
state. We think that the mind itself is actually pleasurable or
peaceful. But really the mind has not created any real pleasure or pain.
These thoughts have come and tricked it and it has got caught up in
them. So we really have to come and train our minds in order to grow in
wisdom. So that we understand the true nature of thoughts rather than
just following them blindly.</p>

<p>The mind is naturally peaceful. It’s in order to understand just this
much that we have come together to do this difficult practice of
meditation.</p>
